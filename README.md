**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

To the Shareholders of ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A.,

**Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**Opinion**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of ACS, Actividades de Construcción y
Servicios, S.A. (the Parent) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated
statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated statement of profit or
loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity,
consolidated statement of cash flows and notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year
then ended.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December
2023, and its consolidated results and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EUIFRSs) and the other provisions of the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the
Group in Spain.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain. Our responsibilities
under those regulations are further described in the _Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the_
_Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report._

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those
pertaining to independence, that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in
Spain pursuant to the audit regulations in force. In this regard, we have not provided any services
other than those relating to the audit of financial statements and there have not been any situations
or circumstances that, in accordance with the aforementioned audit regulations, might have affected
the requisite independence in such a way as to compromise our independence.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.

**Key Audit Matters**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in
our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.


-----

**Recognition of revenue from long-term contracts and of amounts to be billed for work**
**performed**

**Description** **Procedures applied in the audit**


In order to recognise revenue from its longterm construction contracts, the Group
generally uses the percentage of completion
method provided for in IFRS 15.

This revenue recognition method was a key
matter in our audit since it affects a significant
amount of the total volume of consolidated
revenue and the measurement of the
amounts to be billed for work performed,
which at 31 December 2023 amounted to EUR
2,878,917 thousand. The percentage of
completion method requires the use of very
significant estimates by Group management,
relating mainly to the expected outcome of
the contract, the amount of costs to be
incurred at the end of the construction work,
the measurement of work completed in the
period and the accounting for modifications to
the initial contract, all of which impact the
revenue recognised in the year.

It should be noted in this connection that, in
accordance with the revenue recognition
standard (IFRS 15), contract modifications are
recognised when the Group has received
approval for them from the customer. Also, if
the parties are in the process of agreeing upon
a modification or if it is being negotiated or is
under dispute, the corresponding revenue is
recognised for an amount in relation to which
it is highly probable that a significant reversal
therein will not occur when the uncertainty
associated therewith is resolved.


Our audit procedures included, among others,
the review of the design and implementation
of the relevant controls that mitigate the risks
associated with the process of recognising
revenue from long-term contracts.

In order to perform substantive tests, we first
selected a sample by applying quantitative
and qualitative criteria, and then identified
the contracts deemed to be significant either
due to the total selling price of the contracts,
or due to the revenue amount or contract
margins or assets associated with the
contracts.

We performed an in-depth and itemised
analysis of the selected projects in order to
evaluate the reasonableness of the
hypotheses and assumptions made by the
Group, which included, among others, the
determination of the transaction price, the
recognition of the modifications approved by
the customer and the treatment for
accounting purposes of the variable
consideration taken into account in the
objective transaction price. As regards the
amounts to be billed for work performed, we
analysed whether the recognition of revenue
from work in progress that had not been
approved by the end customer was
appropriate in light of the applicable
accounting framework. To this end, and in
order to obtain evidence about the
recoverability of the collection rights arising
from contract modifications and claims, we
evaluated the internal and external evidence
provided by Group management. With respect
to a selection of contracts based on qualitative
and quantitative factors, we analysed the
reasonableness of the most significant
positions.


-----

**Recognition of revenue from long-term contracts and of amounts to be billed for work**
**performed**

**Description** **Procedures applied in the audit**


These judgements and estimates are made by
the persons in charge of the performance of
the construction work, are subsequently
reviewed at the various levels of the
organisation and are submitted to controls
designed to ensure the consistency and
reasonableness of the criteria applied. In this
connection, the construction project budgets,
contract variations and claims must be very
closely monitored.


In addition, in certain individually significant
construction contracts, we involved our
internal infrastructure project experts in order
to assist us in the process of evaluating the
reasonableness of the assumptions and
hypotheses used by the Group to update the
estimated budgeted costs, and to measure
progress towards satisfaction of the
performance obligations.

Lastly, we evaluated whether Notes 03.16 and
12.01 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements were in conformity with
those required by the applicable accounting
regulations.


-----

**Measurement of the investment in Abertis**

**Description** **Procedures applied in the audit**


As indicated in Note 09, the Group recognises
its ownership interest in Abertis Holdco, S.A.,
amounting to EUR 3,523,574 thousand, under
“Investments Accounted for Using the Equity
Method”.

At least once a year, and more often if there
are indications of impairment, the Parent's
directors review the fair value of this
ownership interest by discounting the cash
flows relating to the Abertis Holdco, S.A. and
subsidiaries group.

The measurement of the investment in
Abertis is a key matter in our audit since it
requires the use of judgement by the Parent's
directors in relation to both the methodology
used and the estimates considered as a basis
for the measurement of the investment.


Our audit procedures included, among others,
the review of the design and implementation
of the relevant controls established to detect
indications of impairment in relation to the
investment.

Also, we involved our valuation specialists to
evaluate the reasonableness of the
assumptions and data employed by
management and the directors of the Parent
to estimate fair value using the equity
method. We also performed a sensitivity
analysis of the key assumptions identified.

Lastly, we checked that the disclosures
furnished in Notes 02.02-e) and 09 to the
accompanying consolidated financial
statements in connection with this matter
were in conformity with those required by the
applicable accounting regulations.

**Sale of a controlling interest in Blueridge Transportation Group**

**Description** **Procedures applied in the audit**


At the reporting date, the Group had
completed the sale to Abertis Infraestructuras,
S.A. of a 56.76% controlling interest owned by
it in Blueridge Transportation Group, LLC.
(“BTG”), the concession operator of State
Highway 288 in Houston (United States), for
EUR 1,423 million, as detailed in Notes 02.2.f)
and 29 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, which gave rise to the
recognition of a gain, net of expenses and
provisions for guarantees associated with the
transaction, amounting to EUR 180 million.

As a result of the aforementioned transaction,
and pursuant to the standard on business
combinations, after it had been determined
that the Group had lost control of the
business, the 43.24% ownership interest still
held began to be accounted for using the
equity method. In addition, the recognition at
fair value of the net assets of the Group's
previously held equity interest gave rise to a
gain of EUR 262 million.

We identified this matter as key in our audit
because of the significance of the amounts
involved and because the accounting
treatment of transactions of this nature,
which are unusual transactions, requires the
use of significant judgements and estimates,
including factors such as the determination of
loss of control, the use of valuation techniques
to determine the fair value of the assets and
the quantification of any obligations that
might arise from the sale agreement.


Our audit procedures consisted of, among
others, the obtainment and analysis of the
assessment of the Group’s loss of control of
BTG and the date on which this occurred, on
the basis of the purchase and sale agreements
entered into.

We also recalculated the gain obtained on the
sale of the 56.76% ownership interest in BTG
taking into account every relevant aspect of
the transaction, as well as the contractual
obligations assumed, and we obtained
evidence supporting the payment made to the
Group.

In addition, we evaluated the reasonableness
of the amount recognised in profit or loss for
the year as a consequence of the
measurement at fair value of the previously
held equity interest.

We also reviewed the appropriateness and
content of the disclosures relating to this
transaction in Notes 02.02.f), 29.a) and 32 to
the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.


-----

**Emphasis of Matters**

We draw attention to Note 02.01, which indicates that on 21 March 2024 the Parent's directors reauthorised for issue the Group's consolidated financial statements for 2023, on which we had issued,
on 21 March 2024, our auditor's report in which we expressed an unmodified opinion. On 4 April
2024, the Parent’s directors reissued the aforementioned previously issued consolidated financial
statements, in order to include in Note 32 “Events after the Reporting Period” in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements additional information on the direct and indirect ownership interest
in Blueridge Transportation Group, LLC. (SH-288), the future outcome of the matters indicated in
which could affect the recoverable amount of that investment. This report supersedes that previously
issued.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

**Other Matter**

The Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 were audited
by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on 23 March 2023.

**Other Information: Consolidated Directors’ Report**

The other information comprises only the consolidated directors’ report for 2023, the preparation of
which is the responsibility of the Parent’s directors and which does not form part of the consolidated
financial statements.

Our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the consolidated directors’
report. Our responsibility relating to the consolidated directors' report, in accordance with the audit
regulations in force, consists of:

a) Solely checking that the consolidated non-financial information statement, certain information

included in the Annual Corporate Governance Report and the Annual Directors' Remuneration
Report, to which the Spanish Audit Law refers, have been furnished as provided for in the
applicable legislation and, if this is not the case, reporting this fact.

b) Evaluating and reporting on whether the other information included in the consolidated directors’

report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, based on the knowledge of the
Group obtained in the audit of those consolidated financial statements, as well as evaluating and
reporting on whether the content and presentation of this section of the consolidated directors’
report are in conformity with the applicable regulations. If, based on the work we have performed,
we conclude that there are material misstatements, we are required to report that fact.

Based on the work performed, as described above, we observed that the information described in
section a) above had been furnished as provided for in the applicable legislation and that the other
information in the consolidated directors’ report was consistent with that contained in the
consolidated financial statements for 2023 and its content and presentation were in conformity with
the applicable regulations.


-----

**Responsibilities of the Directors and Audit Committee of the Parent for the**
**Consolidated Financial Statements**

The Parent’s directors are responsible for preparing the accompanying consolidated financial
statements so that they present fairly the Group’s consolidated equity, consolidated financial position
and consolidated results in accordance with EU-IFRSs and the other provisions of the regulatory
financial reporting framework applicable to the Group in Spain, and for such internal control as the
directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Parent’s directors are responsible for assessing
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate
the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Parent's audit committee is responsible for overseeing the process involved in the preparation
and presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is
included in Appendix I to this auditor's report. This description, which is on pages 10 and 11, forms
part of our auditor’s report.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

**European Single Electronic Format**

We have examined the digital files in European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) of ACS, Actividades de
Construcción y Servicios, S.A. and subsidiaries for 2023, which comprise the XHTML file including the
consolidated financial statements for 2023 and the XBRL files with the tagging performed by the
entity, which will form part of the annual financial report.

The directors of ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. are responsible for presenting the
annual financial report for 2023 in accordance with the format and markup requirements established
in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 of 17 December 2018 (“ESEF Regulation”). In this
regard, the Annual Corporate Governance Report and the Annual Directors’ Remuneration Report
were included by reference in the consolidated directors’ report.

Our responsibility is to examine the digital files prepared by the Parent’s directors, in accordance with
the audit regulations in force in Spain. Those regulations require that we plan and perform our audit
procedures in order to ascertain whether the content of the consolidated financial statements
included in the aforementioned digital files corresponds in full to that of the consolidated financial
statements that we have audited, and whether those consolidated financial statements and the
aforementioned files were formatted and marked up, in all material respects, in accordance with the
requirements established in the ESEF Regulation.

In our opinion, the digital files examined correspond in full to the audited consolidated financial
statements, and these are presented and have been marked up, in all material respects, in accordance
with the requirements established in the ESEF Regulation.

**Appendix I** **to our auditor's report**

Further to the information contained in our auditor’s report, in this Appendix we include our
responsibilities in relation to the audit of the consolidated financial statements.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

As part of an audit in accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain, we exercise professional
judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

-  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,

whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.

-  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit

procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.

-  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting

estimates and related disclosures made by the Parent’s directors.

-  Conclude on the appropriateness of the use by the Parent’s directors of the going concern basis of

accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or
conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

-  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,

including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.


-----

-  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or

business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain
solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Parent's audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in
internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Parent's audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements, including those regarding independence, and we have communicated with it to
report on all matters that may reasonably be thought to jeopardise our independence, and where
applicable, on the related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Parent's audit committee, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period
and are therefore the key audit matters.

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure
about the matter.

**02. Basis of presentation of the Consolidated Annual Accounts and basis of**

**consolidation**

**_02.01._** **_Basis of presentation_**

The Consolidated Annual Accounts of the ACS Group for 2023 were prepared:

– By the Parent Company’s directors, at the Board meeting held on 21 March 2024, and reissued on
April 4, 2024 exclusively to include certain additional information in the Note of Events after the

– In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the
European Union, in conformity with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and
of the Council and subsequent amendments, and in accordance with the format and labelling
requirements set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815. The consolidation bases
and the principal accounting policies and measurement bases applied in preparing the Group’s
Consolidated Annual Accounts for 2023 are summarised in Notes 02 and 03.

– Taking into account all the mandatory accounting principles and rules and measurement bases with
a material effect on the Consolidated Annual Accounts, and the alternative treatments permitted by
the relevant standards in this connection, which are specified in Note 03 (Accounting policies).

– So that they present fairly the Group’s consolidated equity and financial position at 31 December

– On the basis of the accounting records kept by the Parent Company and by the other Group
companies.

Notwithstanding the above, it should be noted that, as a result of the macroeconomic environment in which
the ACS Group operates, which has led to uncertainty regarding how markets will perform, the relevant
accounting estimates and significant judgements made in the preparation of the ACS Group’s Consolidated
Annual Accounts are affected by a greater degree of uncertainty. Therefore, the effects on the ACS Group’s
Consolidated Annual Accounts have been assessed and analysed and are set out below in the following
note.

Macroeconomic backdrop

The ACS Group is exposed to risks arising from the businesses and sectors in which it operates. In addition,
given that the Group operates in different countries, it is exposed to various regulatory and macroeconomic
environments and is therefore exposed to any risks stemming from the performance of the global economy.
Current conflicts such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and the effects of sanctions and other actions by
several countries on the Russian economy intended to isolate and weaken it), the conflict between Israel
and Gaza, and the situation in the Red Sea, although they have not had a significant impact on the ACS
Group’s business activities as of the date of these Consolidated Annual Accounts, are causing inflationary
pressure and supply chain problems and, in general, are significantly disrupting the global economy, and
increasing economic uncertainty and asset value volatility. The ACS Group continues to monitor the
situation’s potential impact on operating and financial performance in the activities of its various divisions.
Although the current situation caused by the various conflicts has given rise to uncertainty regarding the
performance and development of the markets and the infrastructure industry, the Group is reducing the risk
profile of its new contracts, is highly diversified by activities and is located in developed regions with stable
political frameworks that allow any potential impacts that may arise in the future to be mitigated (see Note
27).

Issues related to climate change

ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A., as the head of the ACS Group, integrates
environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and, in particular, the risks and opportunities of climate
change, into its operating activities. Environmental, social and governance factors are integrated into its
strategy, risk management and the establishment of measurable and objective parameters and their
assessment. ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A., as the Parent Company of the ACS
Group, is committed to operating in a sustainable manner and the ACS Group’s Directors’ Report (and in
particular the Non-Financial Information Statement) provides detailed information on its performance and
progress in environmental, social and governance matters.

The potential impacts of environmental, social and governance factors, and especially those related to
climate change, were considered in the Consolidated Annual Accounts (see Note 21.08), including the
potential impact on expected cash flows from the ACS Group’s construction, concession and services
activities. It should be noted that the ACS Group’s business activities primarily consist of construction and
services activities and that, with the exception of certain concession investments, it is not the long-term
owner of the projects it carries out.

Comparative information

The information contained in these Consolidated Annual Accounts of the ACS Group for the year ended 31
December 2022 is presented solely for comparative purposes with each item in the consolidated statement
of financial position, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the
explanatory notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023.

The explanatory notes include events or changes that might appear significant in explaining changes in the
financial position and consolidated results of the ACS Group since the Group’s last Consolidated Annual
Accounts for 2022.

The ACS Group’s Consolidated Annual Accounts for 2022, (IFRSs as adopted by the European Union) were
approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of ACS, Actividades de Construcción y
Servicios, S.A. held on 5 May 2023.

The ACS Group’s Consolidated Annual Accounts for 2023 have not yet been approved by the shareholders
at the Annual General Meeting. However, the Parent Company’s Board of Directors considers that these
Consolidated Annual Accounts will be approved without any material changes.

Responsibility for the information and estimates made

The information in these Consolidated Annual Accounts is the responsibility of the directors of the Group’s
Parent Company.

The Consolidated Annual Accounts were prepared from the accounting records for 2023 of ACS, Actividades
de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. and of the companies included in the scope of consolidation.

In preparing this Consolidated Annual Accounts for the ACS Group for the year ended 31 December 2023,
estimates were occasionally made by the senior executives of the Group and of the consolidated entities, to
quantify certain of the assets, liabilities, income, expenses and obligations reported in these annual
accounts.

– The assessment of impairment losses on certain assets (Notes 03.01, 03.06 and 10) and, in
particular, the assumptions and hypotheses considered in the analysis of the recoverability of the
investment in Abertis (Note 09) and goodwill (Note 03.01).

– The fair value of the assets acquired and of the liabilities assumed in business combinations (Note
02.02.f) and the assignment of the Purchase Price Allocation in acquisitions.

– The recognition of earnings in construction contracts (Note 03.16.01).

– The amount of certain provisions (Note 03.13).

– The assumptions used in the calculation of liabilities and obligations to employees (Note 03.12.04).

– The market value of derivatives (such as equity swaps, interest rate swaps, forward contracts, put
option granted to Elliott on the interest in Thiess, the put option granted to Elliott to sell its Class C
preference shares in Thiess, etc.) mentioned in Note 22.

– The useful life of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Notes 03.02 and 03.03).

– The recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note 26.05).

– The determination of the fair value of financial assets (“earn-out”) and their consideration as
discontinued operations (Note 03.09.02).

– Environmental issues and their effect on assumptions of accounting estimates and judgements
related to financial information (Note 21.08).

– Financial risk management (Note 21).

Although these estimates were made on the basis of the best information available at the date of reissued of
these Consolidated Annual Accounts on the events analysed, events that take place in the future might
make it necessary to change these estimates (upwards or downwards) in coming years. Changes in
accounting estimates would be applied prospectively, recognising the effects of the change in estimates in
the related future Consolidated Annual Accounts.

Changes in accounting estimates and policies and correction of fundamental errors

– Changes in accounting estimates

The effect of any change in accounting estimates is recognised in the same income statement line item as
that in which the expense or income measured using the previous estimate had been previously recognised.


-----

17

– Changes in accounting policies and correction of fundamental errors

In accordance with IAS 8, the effect of any change in accounting policies and of any correction of
fundamental errors is recognised as follows: the cumulative effect at the beginning of the year is adjusted in
reserves, whereas the effect on the current year is adjusted in profit or loss. Also, in these cases, the
financial data for the comparative year presented together with those for the current year are restated.

No errors were corrected in the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022. There
were also no significant changes in accounting policies.

Bases of consolidation

Except for the above and the entry into force of new accounting standards, the bases of consolidation
applied in 2023 are consistent with those applied in the Consolidated Annual Accounts for 2022 (see Note
03.24).

**Currency**

The euro is the currency in which the Consolidated Annual Accounts are presented. Details of sales in the
main countries in which the Group operates are set out in Note 25.

**_02.02._** **_Basis of consolidation_**

a) Balances and transactions with Group companies and associates

The significant intra-Group balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation. Accordingly, the
gains obtained are eliminated in line with the percentage of ownership in the case of the associates and in
full in the case of the fully consolidated companies.

However, in accordance with the criteria provided by IFRIC 12, balances and transactions relating to
construction projects performed by companies of the Construction Division for concession operators are not
eliminated on consolidation since these transactions are considered to have been carried out for third
parties as the projects are being completed.

b) Standardisation of items

To uniformly present the various items comprising these Consolidated Annual Accounts, accounting
standardisation criteria were applied to the separate annual accounts of the companies included in the
scope of consolidation.

In 2023 and 2022 the reporting date of the annual accounts of all the companies included in the scope of
consolidation was the same or was temporarily brought into line with that of the Parent Company.

c) Subsidiaries

“Subsidiaries” are defined as companies over which the ACS Group has the capacity to exercise control,
i.e., in accordance with IFRS 10, when it has the power to direct their relevant activities, it is exposed to
variable returns as a result of its involvement with the investee and is able to use this power to affect its own
returns, either directly or through other companies it controls.

The annual accounts of the subsidiaries are fully consolidated with those of the Parent Company. Where
necessary, adjustments are made to the annual accounts of the subsidiaries to adapt the accounting policies
used to those applied by the Group and they are fully consolidated.

As at 31 December 2023, the ACS Group had an effective ownership interest of less than 50% in companies
considered to be subsidiaries, because it controls the majority of the voting rights of these companies, the
most representative of which have an asset volume of more than EUR 4 million: Piques y Túneles, S.A.,
Consorcio Embalse Chironta, S.A., Consorcio Constructor Hospital de Quellón, S.A. and Consorcio


-----

18

Constructor Puente Santa Elvira, S.A. (these four companies were in the same situation as at 31 December
2022). The ACS Group fully consolidates these investees as it has the power, the rights to variable returns
and the ability to affect these returns through the power it exercises.

As at 31 December 2023, the main companies of the ACS Group with dividend rights of more than 50% that
are not fully consolidated include: Road Management (A13) Plc. and Benisaf Water Company, Spa. (these
companies were in the same situation as at 31 December 2022).

This circumstance arises because the control over these companies is exercised by other shareholders or
because decisions require the affirmative vote of another or other shareholders and, therefore, they are
accounted for using the equity method. The relevant decisions vary depending on each resolution but, in
general, the other shareholder can veto any decision regarding (i) appointment, renewal, removal or
replacement of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Operating Officer
(COO), (ii) approval of distribution of dividends or reserves not approved in the business plan, (iii) any
change in the business activity, (iv) approval of the business plan and approval of the annual budget and/or
final investment decision for a development project, (v) refinancing or restructuring or rebalancing
agreements, (vi) changes in financial policies (hedging, leverage, guarantees, etc.), (vii) approval of the
annual accounts and allocation of profit or loss, etc.

On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair
values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable
net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values
of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. a discount on acquisition) is credited to profit or loss on the
acquisition date. The interest of minority shareholders is stated at their proportion of the fair values of the
assets and liabilities recognised.

Also, the share of third parties of:

– The equity of their investees is presented within the Group’s equity under “Non-controlling interests”
in the consolidated statement of financial position.

– The profit for the year is presented under “Profit/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests” and
“Profit/(loss) from discontinued operations attributable to non-controlling interests” in the
consolidated income statement and in the consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group.

The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from
the date of acquisition to year-end. Similarly, the results of subsidiaries disposed of during the year are
included in the consolidated income statement from the beginning of the year to the date of disposal.

Appendix I to these notes to the consolidated annual accounts details the subsidiaries and information
related to them.

Section f) of this Note contains information on acquisitions, disposals, and increases and decreases in
ownership interest.

d) Joint arrangements

The Group recognises in the consolidated annual accounts its assets, including its share of jointly controlled
assets; its liabilities, including its share of liabilities incurred jointly with the other operators; the revenue
obtained from the sale of its share of the production resulting from the joint operation, its share of the
revenue obtained from the sale of the production resulting from the joint operation; and its expenses,
including its share of the joint expenditure.

Within the joint arrangements in which the ACS Group operates, mention should be made of temporary joint
ventures and similar entities (various types of joint ventures) abroad, which are entities through which
cooperation arrangements are entered into with other venturers to carry out a project or provide a service for
a limited period of time.


-----

19

The assets and liabilities assigned to these types of entities are recognised in the consolidated statement of
financial position, classified according to their specific nature in proportion to the Group’s percentage of
ownership. Similarly, income and expenses arising from these entities is recognised in the consolidated
income statement on the basis of their specific nature and in proportion to the Group’s ownership interest.

Notes 08 and 09 contain relevant information on material entities.

e) Associates

The companies over which the ACS Group has significant influence or joint control are accounted for using
the equity method in those cases where they do not meet the requirements of IFRS 11 to be classified as
joint arrangements.

Exceptionally, the following entities are not considered to be Group associates since they do not have a
significant influence or are fully inoperative and irrelevant for the Group as a whole.

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method, whereby they are initially recognised
at acquisition cost. Subsequently, on each reporting date, they are measured at cost, plus the changes in
the net assets of the associate based on the Group’s percentage of ownership. The excess of the cost of
acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair value of the net assets of the associate at the date of
acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill relating to an associate is included in the carrying
amount of the investment and is not amortised. Any excess of the Group’s share of the fair value of the net
assets of the associate over acquisition cost at the acquisition date is recognised in the consolidated income
statement.

The profit, net of taxes, of associates is included in the Group’s consolidated income statement under
“Ordinary results of companies accounted for using the equity method” for all those associates and joint
ventures whose activity is part of the same operational business of the Group, and under “Non-ordinary
results of companies accounted for using the equity method” for those whose activity is not part of the
Group’s operational business (after an individual analysis has been carried out on each of them), based on
their percentage of ownership. Previously, the appropriate adjustments are made to take into account the
depreciation of the depreciable assets based on their fair value at the date of acquisition.

Any losses in associates that correspond to the Group are limited to the value of the net investment, except
in those cases where legal or constructive obligations had been assumed by the Group or it has made
payments on behalf of the associates. For the purpose of recognising impairment losses in associates, the
net investment is considered to be the result of adding the amount corresponding to any other item that, in
substance, forms part of the investment in the associates to the carrying amount resulting from having been
accounted for using the equity method. Any excess losses on the investment in equity instruments is applied
to the other items in reverse order to the priority in liquidation. Any profit subsequently obtained by the
associates, in which the recognition of losses was limited to the value of the investment, is recognised if it
exceeds the losses not previously recognised.

In addition, the Group’s share of other comprehensive income of the associates obtained since the date of
acquisition is recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the investments in associates and the
balancing entry is recognised by nature in other comprehensive income. Dividend distributions are
recognised as reductions in the value of the investments. To determine the Group’s share of profit or loss,
including impairment losses recognised by associates, income or expenses arising from the acquisition
method are taken into consideration.

After applying the equity method, the Group assesses whether there is objective evidence of impairment of
the net investment in the associate.

The impairment loss is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the net investment in the associate
with its recoverable amount, which is understood as the higher of value in use or fair value less costs to sell
or of disposal. Value in use is calculated based on the Group’s interest in the present value of the estimated
cash flows from ordinary activities and the amounts that could be received from the ultimate disposal of the


-----

20

associate. The recoverable amount of an investment in an associate is assessed in relation to each
associate unless it does not constitute a cash-generating unit (CGU).

The impairment loss is not allocated to goodwill or other assets embedded in the investment in associates
as a result of applying the acquisition method. In subsequent periods, impairment losses on investments are
reversed in profit or loss if there is an increase in the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is
recognised separately from the Group’s share in the profit or loss of the associates.

Note 09 contains relevant information on material entities.

f) Business combinations and changes in the scope of consolidation

**Business combinations**

The Group accounts for business combinations using the purchase method. The acquisition date is the date
on which the Group takes control of the acquired business.

The consideration given in the business combination is determined on the acquisition date as the sum of the
fair values of the assets delivered, the liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued and any
contingent consideration that depends on future events or compliance with certain conditions in exchange
for control of the acquired business, excluding any expenditure that does not form part of the exchange for
the acquired business. The costs related to the acquisition are recognised as an expense as they are
incurred.

The Group recognises the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interests at fair
value on the acquisition date. The non-controlling interests in the acquired business are recognised at the
amount corresponding to the ownership interest in the fair value of the net assets acquired. The liabilities
assumed include contingent liabilities insofar as they represent present obligations that arise from past
events and their fair value can be reliably measured.

The excess between the consideration given, plus the value assigned to non-controlling interests, and the
net amount of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency, after
assessing the amount of the consideration given, the value assigned to non-controlling interests and the
identification and measurement of the net assets acquired, is recognised under a separate line item in the
consolidated income statement.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which
the combination occurs, the acquirer will report in its financial statements provisional amounts for the items
for which the accounting is incomplete. During the measurement period, the acquirer will retrospectively
adjust the provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The measurement period will not exceed
one year from the acquisition date.

**Changes in the scope of consolidation**

The main changes in the scope of consolidation of the ACS Group (consisting of ACS, Actividades de
Construcción y Servicios, S.A. and its Subsidiaries) in the year ended 31 December 2023 are detailed in
Appendix III.

Acquisitions, sales, and other corporate transactions

SH288

In 2022, the Group entered into certain purchase and sale agreements with four partners of the US
company Blueridge Transportation Group (BTG), which was the successful bidder on the operation of the
concession of a 17-km. segment of the SH288 highway in Houston, Texas, for the purchase of an additional
56.76% of the highway. After the fulfilment of the conditions precedent on which this purchase depended,
the acquisition was accounted for in December 2022.


-----

21

The amount of this acquisition stood at EUR 1,063 million (USD 1,141 million). Following this acquisition, the
Group’s total interest in the project amounted to 78.38%, giving the Group a majority of the voting rights and,
therefore, control of the company, given that it manages its relevant activities. As a result, the company
became fully consolidated. Given that the Group previously held a 21.62% interest in this concession, with a
carrying amount of approximately EUR 70 million, and considering the fair value resulting from the previous
purchase transaction in accordance with accounting standards, so as to present the originally held interest
at fair value, a positive impact of EUR 334.8 million was therefore recognised under “Impairment and gains
or losses on disposal of non-current assets” in the consolidated income statement at year-end 2022.

In relation to the application of the standard on business combinations, after assessing the acquisition of
control, the date on which control was obtained and whether the acquisition constitutes a business, IFRS 3
establishes that the acquirer will measure the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at their fair value at
the acquisition date. The fair value of the net assets acquired was calculated based on the analysis and
valuation performed by Group Management as a result of its extensive knowledge of the concession
business. The main impact of the provisional purchase price allocation process consisted of assigning a
higher value to the toll road concession asset, net of the tax effect, which was calculated based on the
discounted cash flows of the project at a market discount rate of 6.7% until the end of the concession
(2068). The business combination resulted in allocated goodwill of EUR 388 million.

The acquired business did not generate a significant amount of revenue or profit for the Group during the
period between the takeover and the end of the 2022 reporting period, since control was obtained in
December 2022. If the acquisition had taken place on 1 January 2022, the revenue contributed by the
concession would have amounted to EUR 67.1 million and profit for the year ended 31 December 2022
would have amounted to EUR 14.1 million. As at 31 December 2022, the Group had yet to pay the amount
of the acquisition, which was fully paid in January 2023.

At year-end 2022, the assets and liabilities of the SH288 highway were classified under “Non-current assets
held for sale” and “Liabilities related to non-current assets held for sale” given that the Group had formally
decided to sell this asset and a plan for its sale had been initiated (see Note 03.09).

Next, on 31 March 2023, Iridium entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Shikun & Binui Ltd. for
the acquisition of the remaining 21.62% of the concession operator, giving it a 100% interest. On 12
September 2023, after fulfilment of the conditions precedent to carry out the purchase, Iridium executed the
transaction, giving it a 100% interest in the concession operator. The acquisition price stood at EUR 383
million (USD 410.7 million). Pursuant to the standard on business combinations, the transaction was
recognised for accounting purposes as an acquisition of the non-controlling interests by the parent. This
transaction had practically no impact on reserves, as the acquisition price of the remaining 21.62% of the
SH288 was in line with the valuation of the Group’s ownership interest in the concession operator, which
was the result of the acquisition price of the interest at year-end 2022.

Throughout 2023, the Group continued to work on the plan to sell the SH288 until an agreement was
reached in July 2023. In September 2023, a sale and purchase agreement was entered into to transfer the
56.76% interest in the concession operator to Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. Specifically, on 27 December
2023, once the required authorisations had been obtained, this interest was transferred for EUR 1,423
million (USD 1,533 million). This gave rise to a gain net of transaction-related expenses, and certain
commitments and potential contingencies that could arise from the sale agreements, of EUR 180 million,
which was recognised under “Impairment and gains or losses on disposal of non-current assets” in the
consolidated income statement at year-end 2023. The Group will reassess these contingencies on a regular
basis.

In accordance with the standard on business combinations, once the Group’s loss of control of the business
had been assessed, its 43.24% interest in the SH288 was accounted for using the equity method. The loss
of control also made it necessary to recognise a positive impact of EUR 262 million under “Impairment and
gains or losses on disposal of non-current assets” in the Group’s income statement as a result of the
difference between the previous carrying amount of the investment held (EUR 793 million) and its fair value.
The fair value of the net assets acquired as a result of the loss of control was calculated — as was the case
with the takeover in 2022 — by measuring the toll road concession asset based on the project’s discounted
cash flows (the most significant assumptions of which relate mainly to the performance of traffic, tolls and


-----

22

inflation throughout the concession period). This calculation was also the basis for setting the price of the
investment that was sold.

At 31 December 2023, the Group had formally decided to sell 21.62% of its total interest in the SH288
operator. Therefore, at year-end 21.62% of the investment was classified as “Non-current assets held for
sale” (see Note 03.09.01) and the remaining 21.62% as “Investments in companies accounted for using the
equity method” (see Note 09).

Other transactions

On 6 July 2023, Cimic, through its investee Sedgman Pty Limited, acquired 100% of Novopro Projects Inc.
for AUD 17 million (EUR 10.5 million). Novopro is a Canadian engineering and metallurgical company that
provides services for projects carried out in North America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Australia. Its
core business and area of specialisation is project development and operational optimisation in mineral
processing for lithium, potash, salt, magnesium and soda ash projects.

In April 2022, Clece Care Services Ltd. (CCS) acquired 100% of the CSN Care Group in the United
Kingdom for EUR 23,863 thousand. The first-time consolidation difference generated was negligible.

On 26 July 2022, Thiess announced that it had entered into a bid execution agreement with MACA Limited
(“MACA”). Thiess agreed to make an offer to MACA shareholders to acquire all of the issued shares through
a conditional off-market takeover bid. Thiess offered MACA shareholders a consideration in cash of AUD
1.025 per share. The takeover bid for MACA launched by Cimic was concluded in October 2022 for EUR
242 million. This acquisition is an important part of the strategy that Thiess has to diversify its operations
among commodities, services and geographical areas (see Note 09.02).

As at 31 December 2021, Cimic had recognised its investment in Ventia as being accounted for using the
equity method, given that it exercised significant influence. In the first quarter of 2022, Cimic decided, for an
initial period of 18 months until September 2023, to remove its directors appointed to the board of directors
of Ventia and to waive some of its rights as a significant shareholder under the agreement with Ventia
regarding the appointment of directors and other protective rights.

As a result, and in accordance with current accounting regulations, Cimic’s management considered that it
had lost its significant influence over Ventia, since it no longer had decision-making powers over the
financial operating policies of its investment in Ventia. In addition, the protective rights established in the
agreement are rights that may be exercised by any Ventia shareholder. Ventia therefore lost its status as
associate and is now recognised as a financial asset under IFRS 9 at fair value through profit or loss based
on Ventia’s quoted market price at 31 March 2022 (level 1 of the hierarchy). As a result, on 31 March 2022
Cimic recognised a profit before tax (without any effect on cash flow) of EUR 338.3 million (AUD 502 million)
under “Impairment and gains or losses on disposal of non-current assets” (see Note 29) in the
accompanying consolidated income statement. Cimic made an irrevocable election under IFRS 9 to
recognise future changes in the value of the financial asset under “Other comprehensive income”. The
shareholding at 31 December 2022 was 32.8%. In 2023, after reclassifying the shareholding as a noncurrent asset held for sale, the Company proceeded to sell all of Ventia’s shares for EUR 417 million (see
Note 03.09.01).

**03. Accounting policies**

The principal accounting policies used in preparing the Group’s Consolidated Annual Accounts, in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union,
were as follows:

**_03.01._** **_Goodwill_**

Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in
the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.


-----

23

Any excess of the cost of the investments in the consolidated companies over the corresponding underlying
carrying amounts acquired, adjusted at the date of first-time consolidation, is allocated as follows:

– That attributable to specific assets and liabilities of the companies acquired, increasing the value of
the assets (or reducing the value of the liabilities) whose market values were higher (lower) than the
carrying amounts at which they had been recognised in their balance sheets and whose accounting
treatment (amortisation, accrual, etc.) was similar to that of the same assets (liabilities) of the
Group. That attributable to specific intangible assets, recognising it explicitly in the consolidated
statement of financial position provided the fair value at the acquisition date can be measured
reliably.

– Goodwill is only recognised when it has been acquired for consideration and represents, therefore,
a payment made by the acquirer in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets of the
acquired company that are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised.

– Goodwill acquired on or after 1 January 2004 is measured at acquisition cost and that acquired
earlier is recognised at the carrying amount at 31 December 2003.

In all cases, at the end of each reporting period goodwill is reviewed for impairment (i.e., a reduction in its
recoverable amount to below its carrying amount) and, if there is any impairment, the goodwill is written
down with a charge to “Impairment and gains or losses on disposal of non-current assets” in the
consolidated income statement, since, as stipulated in IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised.

An impairment loss recognised for goodwill must not be reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the
determination of the gain or loss on disposal.

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of companies with a functional currency other than the euro is translated
to euros at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the consolidated statement of financial position and
changes are recognised as translation differences or impairment, as appropriate.

Any deficiency of the cost of investments in consolidated companies and associates below the related
underlying carrying amounts acquired, adjusted at the date of first-time consolidation, is classified as
negative goodwill and is allocated as follows:

– If the negative goodwill is attributable to specific assets and liabilities of the companies acquired, by
increasing the value of the liabilities (or reducing the value of the assets) whose market values were
higher (lower) than the carrying amounts at which they had been recognised in their balance sheets
and whose accounting treatment (amortisation, accrual, etc.) was similar to that of the same assets
(liabilities) of the Group.

– The remaining amounts are presented under “Other results” in the consolidated income statement
for the year in which the share capital of the subsidiary or associate is acquired.

**_03.02._** **_Other intangible assets_**

Other intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets, without physical substance, which arise as a
result of a legal transaction or which are developed internally by the consolidated companies. Only assets
whose cost can be estimated reliably and from which the consolidated companies consider it probable that
future economic benefits will be generated are recognised.

Intangible assets are measured initially at acquisition or production cost and are subsequently measured at
cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. These assets are
amortised over their useful life.

The ACS Group recognises any impairment loss on the carrying amount of these assets with a charge to
“Impairment and gains or losses on disposal of non-current assets” in the consolidated income statement.
The criteria used to recognise the impairment losses on these assets and, where applicable, the recovery of


-----

24

impairment losses recognised in prior years are similar to those used for property, plant and equipment
(Note 03.06).

03.02.01. Development expenditure

Development expenditure is only recognised as an intangible asset if all of the following conditions are met:

– an identifiable asset is created (such as computer software or new processes);

– it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and

– the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Costs related to research and/or development activities are recognised as an expense as they are incurred.

The costs related to development activities have been capitalised to the extent that:

– The Group has technical studies that justify the viability of the production process;

– There is a commitment from the Group to complete the production of the asset in such a way that is
found in the terms of sale (or internal use);

– The asset will generate sufficient economic benefits;

– The Group has the technical and financial (or other) resources to complete the development of the
asset (or to use it internally) and has developed budgetary control and analytical accounting
systems to track budgeted costs, the modifications introduced and the costs actually charged to the
various projects.

The cost of assets generated internally by the Group is determined according to the same principles as
those established in determining the production cost of inventories. The production cost is capitalised
through payment of the costs attributable to the asset in the accounts under “Capitalised expenses of inhouse work on assets” in the consolidated income statement (consolidated statement of comprehensive
income).

The costs incurred in carrying out activities in which the costs attributable to the research phase cannot be
clearly distinguished from the costs of the intangible assets’ development phase are charged to profit or
loss.

In addition, the costs incurred in carrying out activities that contribute to increasing the value of the various
businesses in which the Group operates as a whole are recognised as expenses as they are incurred. Also,
in general, replacements or costs incurred subsequently on intangibles assets are recognised as an
expense, unless the future economic benefits expected from the assets increase.

Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives (over a
maximum of five years). Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development
expenditure is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.

03.02.02. Administrative concessions

Concessions are recognised as assets when they have been acquired by the Company for a consideration
(in the case of concessions that can be transferred) or for the amount of the expenses incurred to directly
obtain the concession from the State or from the related public agency.

Concessions are generally amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the concession.

In the event of non-compliance, leading to the loss of the concession rights, the carrying amount of the
concession is written off.


-----

25

03.02.03. Computer software

The acquisition and development costs incurred in relation to the basic computer systems used in the
Group’s management are recognised with a charge to “Other intangible assets” in the consolidated
statement of financial position.

Computer system maintenance costs are recognised with a charge to the consolidated income statement for
the year in which they are incurred.

Computer software may be contained in a tangible asset or have physical substance and, therefore,
incorporate both tangible and intangible elements. These assets are recognised as property, plant and
equipment if they constitute an integral part of the related tangible asset, which cannot operate without that
specific software.

Computer software is amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of between three and four years from
the entry into service of each application.

03.02.04. Other intangible assets

This heading basically includes the intangible assets related to the acquired companies’ construction
backlog and customer base, mainly of the Hochtief Group. These intangible assets are measured at fair
value on the date of their acquisition and, if material, on the basis of independent external reports. The
assets are amortised over the five to ten year period in which it is estimated that profit will be contributed to
the Group.

**_03.03._** **_Tangible assets - Property, plant and equipment_**

Land and buildings acquired for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative
purposes are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at acquisition or production cost less
any accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.

The Group recognises the interest costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
qualified assets as an increase in the value of the assets. Qualified assets are those that require a
substantial period of time before they can be used or be subject to disposal. To the extent that the financing
has been obtained specifically for the qualified asset, the amount of interest to be capitalised is determined
on the basis of the actual costs incurred during the financial year minus the revenue obtained from the
temporary investments made with those funds. The financing obtained specifically for a qualified asset is
considered generic financing, once all the activities necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or
sale have been substantially completed. The amount of capitalised interest for generic financing is
determined by applying a weighted average interest rate to the investment in qualified assets, without
exceeding the total interest costs incurred under any circumstances. All other interest costs are recognised
in profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred.

Replacements or renewals of complete items that lead to a lengthening of the useful life of the assets or to
an increase in their economic capacity are recognised as additions to property, plant and equipment, and
the items replaced or renewed are derecognised.

Periodic maintenance, upkeep and repair expenses are recognised in profit or loss on an accrual basis as
incurred.

Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment
loss.

Depreciation is calculated, using the straight-line method, on the basis of the acquisition cost of the assets
less their residual value; the land on which the buildings and other structures stand has an indefinite useful
life and, therefore, is not depreciated.


-----

The period property, plant and equipment depreciation charge is recognised in the consolidated income
statement and is basically based on the application of depreciation rates determined on the basis of the
following average years of estimated useful life of the various assets:

|Col1|Years of estimated useful life|
|---|---|
|Buildings Plant and machinery Other fixtures, tools and furniture Other items of tangible assets - property plant and equipment|20-60 3-20 3-14 4-12|


**Years of**

**estimated**
**useful life**

Buildings 20-60

Plant and machinery 3-20

Other fixtures, tools and furniture 3-14

Other items of tangible assets - property plant and equipment 4-12


Notwithstanding the above, the property, plant and equipment assigned to certain contracts for services that
revert to the contracting agency at the end of the contract term are depreciated over the shorter of the
contractual term or the useful life of the related assets.

Interest relating to the financing of non-current assets held under finance leases is charged to consolidated
profit for the year using the effective interest method, on the basis of the repayment of the related
borrowings. All other interest costs are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between
the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated income
statement.

The future costs that the Group will have to incur in connection with the dismantling, closure and
environmental restoration of certain facilities are capitalised to the cost of the asset, at present value, and
the related provision is recognised. The Group reviews its estimates of these future costs on an annual
basis, adjusting the amount of the provision recognised based on the related studies.

Identified right of use in leases

The ACS Group manages its owned and leased assets to ensure that there is a sufficient level of resources
for it to meet its current obligations. The decision to lease or buy an asset depends on numerous
considerations such as financing, risk management and operational strategies after the planned end to a
project.

With the application of IFRS 16, the Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the
definition of a lease. Under IFRS 16, a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to
control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration.

At the beginning of the lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use
asset consists of the amount of the lease liability; any lease payments made on or before the
commencement date, less any lease incentives received; any initial direct costs incurred; and an estimate of
the dismantling or restoration costs to be incurred, as indicated in the accounting policy on provisions.

The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date. The Group discounts lease payments at the appropriate incremental borrowing rate,
unless it can reliably determine the lessor’s implicit interest rate.

Outstanding lease payments consist of fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable; variable lease
payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate applicable at the
commencement date; amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees; the exercise price
of a purchase option that is reasonably certain to be exercised; and payments of penalties for terminating
the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of the option to terminate the lease.

The Group measures the right-of-use assets at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability.


-----

27

If the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or if the right-of-use
asset includes the purchase option price, the depreciation criteria indicated in the section on property, plant
and equipment will be applied from the commencement date of the lease to the end of the useful life of the
asset. Otherwise, the Group depreciates the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the earlier
of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.

The Group applies the criteria for impairment of non-current assets set out in Note 03.06 to determine
whether the right-of-use asset is impaired.

The Group measures the lease liability by increasing it to reflect the finance cost accrued, reducing it to
reflect the lease payments made, and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any lease modifications or
to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.

Lessees must recognise interest expense on the lease liability separately from the depreciation charge for
the right-of-use asset. Future lease payments (for the purpose of calculating the initial value of the liability)
do not include payments that are variable and do not depend on an index (such as the CPI or an applicable
lease price index) or a rate (such as the Euribor).

However, lessees are required to remeasure the lease liability in the event of certain events (such as a
change in the term or lease payments). The amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability is recognised
as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. The Group recognises the variable lease payments that have not
been included in the initial measurement of the liability in profit or loss for the period in which the events that
triggered its payment occurred.

Variable lease payments were not material at 31 December 2023 or 2022.

The Group recognises remeasurements of the liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset, until it is
reduced to zero and subsequently recognised in profit or loss.

The Group remeasures the lease liability by discounting the lease payments using a revised discount rate if
there is a change in the lease term or a change in the expectation that the option to purchase the underlying
asset will be exercised.

The Group remeasures the lease liability if there is a change in the amounts expected to be payable under a
residual value guarantee or a change in the index or rate used to determine the payments, including a
change to reflect changes in market rental rates following a market rent review.

The standard includes two exemptions to the recognition of lease assets and liabilities by lessees for which
the expense is recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis:

– Leases of low-value assets: this refers to leases of little significance, i.e. those contracts whose
underlying asset is attributed an insignificant value.

– Short-term leases: those contracts with an estimated lease term of 12 months or less.

Sublease income is not significant since the ACS Group companies operate on a lessee rather than a lessor
basis. The Group does not have any material operating leases as a lessor.

The Group does not consider contracts with a lease term of less than one year and for low-value assets,
with the main contracts being those associated with the lease of machinery, offices and transport equipment
in different geographical areas of operation. There may also be some office leases that contain extension
options that can be exercised by Group one year before the non-cancellable period of the lease. The Group
considers these extensions in those cases where it is reasonably certain that the extension option will be
exercised.


-----

28

Lessor’s standpoint:

When the Group acts as lessor, leases are accounted for in accordance with the following criteria:

_Finance leases:_

The Group recognises an account receivable for the amount equivalent to the present value of the lease
payments, plus the unguaranteed residual value, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease (net
investment of the lease). Initial direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the collection rights
and reduce the amount of income recognised over the lease term. Finance income is charged to the income
statement using the effective interest method.

At the beginning of the lease, the Group recognises as a lease receivable the amounts receivable related to
the fixed payments, less any lease incentives payable; the variable lease payments that depend on an index
or a rate, measured using the index or rate applicable at that date; any residual value guarantees provided
to the lessor by the lessee, a party related to the lessee or any third party unrelated to the lessor that is
financially capable of discharging the obligation; the exercise price of any purchase option, if the lessee is
reasonably certain to exercise that option; and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease
term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.

As mentioned previously, sublease income is not significant since the ACS Group companies operate on a
lessee rather than a lessor basis. The Group does not have any material operating leases as a lessor.

**_03.04._** **_Non-current assets in projects_**

This heading includes the amount of investments, mainly in transport, energy and environmental
infrastructures that are operated by ACS Group subsidiaries and that are financed under a project finance
arrangement (limited recourse financing applied to projects).

These financing structures are applied to projects capable in their own right of providing sufficient
guarantees to the participating banks with regard to the repayment of the funds borrowed to finance them.
Each project is performed through specific companies in which the project assets are financed, on the one
hand, through a contribution of funds by the developers, which is limited to a given amount, and on the
other, generally representing a larger amount, through borrowed funds in the form of long-term debt. The
debt servicing of these credit facilities or loans is supported mainly by the cash flows to be generated by the
project in the future and by security interests in the project’s assets.

These assets are valued at the costs directly allocable to construction incurred through their entry into
operation (studies and designs, compulsory purchases, reinstatement of services, project execution, project
management and administration expenses, installations and facilities and similar items) and the related
portion of other indirectly allocable costs, to the extent that they relate to the construction period.

Also included under this heading are the borrowing costs incurred before the entry into operation of the
assets arising from the borrowings arranged to finance the related projects. Capitalised borrowing costs
arise from specific borrowings expressly used for the acquisition of an asset.

Upkeep and maintenance expenses that do not lead to a lengthening of the useful life of the assets or an
increase in their production capacity are expensed currently.

The residual value, useful life and depreciation method applied to the companies’ assets are reviewed
periodically to ensure that the depreciation method used reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits
arising from operating the non-current assets in projects are consumed.

This heading also includes the amount of the concessions to which IFRIC 12 has been applied. These
mainly relate to investments in transport, energy and environmental infrastructures operated by ACS Group
subsidiaries and financed under a project finance arrangement (limited recourse financing applied to
projects), regardless of whether the demand risk is assumed by the group or the financial institution. In
general, the loans are supported by security interests over the project cash flows.


-----

29

The main features to be considered in relation to non-current assets in projects are as follows:

– The concession assets are owned by the concession grantor in most cases.

– The concession grantor controls or regulates the service offered by the concession operator and the
conditions under which it must be provided.

– The assets are operated by the concession operator as established in the concession tender
specifications for an established concession term. At the end of this period, the assets are returned
to the grantor, and the concession operator has no right whatsoever over these assets.

– The concession operator receives revenue for the services provided either directly from the users or
through the grantor.

In general, a distinction must be drawn between two clearly different phases: the first, in which the
concession operator provides construction or upgrade services that are recognised under intangible or
financial assets by reference to the stage of completion pursuant to IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with
customers”, and a second phase in which a series of maintenance or operating services are provided for the
above infrastructure, which are recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with
customers”.

An intangible asset is recognised when the demand risk is borne by the concession operator and a financial
asset is recognised when the demand risk is borne by the concession grantor since the operator has an
unconditional contractual right to receive cash for the construction or upgrade services. These assets also
include the amounts paid and to be paid in relation to the fees for the award of the concessions.

In certain mixed arrangements, the operator and the grantor may share the demand risk, although this is not
common for the ACS Group.

The infrastructures of all the ACS Group’s concessions were built by Group companies and no infrastructure
was built by third parties. The revenue and expenses relating to infrastructure construction or upgrade
services are recognised at their gross amount (recognition of sales and associated costs), with the
construction margin recognised in the Consolidated Annual Accounts.

Intangible assets

For concessions classified as intangible assets, provisions for dismantling, removal and rehabilitation and
any steps to improve and increase capacity, the revenue from which is contemplated in the initial contract,
are capitalised at the start of the concession and the amortisation of these assets and the adjustment for
provision discounting are recognised in profit or loss. Also, provisions to replace and repair the infrastructure
are systematically recognised in profit or loss as the obligation is incurred.

Borrowing costs arising from the financing of the infrastructure are recognised in the period in which they
are incurred and those accruing from the construction until the entry into service of the infrastructure are
capitalised only in the intangible asset model.

Intangible assets are amortised on the basis of the pattern of consumption, taken to be the changes in and
best estimates of the production units of each activity. The most important concession business in
quantitative terms is the toll road activity, whose assets are depreciated or amortised on the basis of the
concession traffic.

Financial assets

Concessions qualifying as financial assets are recognised at the fair value of the construction services or
improvements provided and in which the operator has an unconditional contractual right to receive a
specified amount of cash or another financial asset over the term of the arrangement. In accordance with
the amortised cost method, the related revenue is allocated to profit or loss at the effective interest rate of
the receivable arising on the cash flow and concession payment projections, which are presented as
revenue on the accompanying consolidated income statement. As described previously, the revenue relating


-----

30

to the provision of the operation and maintenance services is recognised in the income statement in
accordance with IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers”. The expenses related to the concession
are recognised in the accompanying consolidated income statement according to their nature.

The Group classifies the financial asset as non-current until it becomes due or the concession ends.

All actions taken in relation to the concession infrastructure, such as maintenance and replacements, give
rise to revenue from services provided that is recognised in the income statement.

The operating expenses incurred by the companies are accounted for on an accrual basis in the income
statement, giving rise to the recognition of revenue from services provided.

The value of the financial asset is increased by recognising the construction services and their performance,
and reduced by the associated net proceeds.

If there are significant changes in the estimates that are indicative of a material change in the effective
interest rate applicable to the concession arrangement, the Group assesses the carrying amount of the
financial asset and adjusts it prospectively, recognising the corresponding impairment loss if the net present
value of the cash flows to be received over the concession term is lower than the carrying amount of the
financial asset.

**_03.05._** **_Investment property_**

The Group classifies as investment property the investments in land and structures held either to earn
rentals or for capital appreciation, rather than for their use in the production or supply of goods or services,
or for administrative purposes; or for their sale in the ordinary course of business. Investment property is
measured initially at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration paid for its acquisition, including
transaction costs. Subsequently, accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, impairment losses are
deducted from the initial cost.

In accordance with IAS 40, the ACS Group has elected not to periodically revaluate its investment property
on the basis of its market value, but rather to recognise it at cost, net of the related accumulated
depreciation, following the same criteria as for “Property, plant and equipment”.

Properties in the course of construction for production, rental or administrative purposes, or for purposes not
yet determined, are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees
and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are
ready for their intended use.

Investment property is derecognised on disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn
from use and no future economic benefits are expected from its sale or disposal by any other means.

Gains or losses arising from the retirement, sale or disposal of the investment property by other means are
determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds from the transaction and the carrying
amount of the asset, and is recognised in profit or loss in the period of the retirement or disposal.

Investment property is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful life, which is estimated to range
from 25 to 50 years based on the features of each asset, less its residual value, if material.

**_03.06._** **_Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding_**
**_goodwill_**

At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets, and its
investment properties, to determine whether there is any indication that those assets might have suffered an
impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine
the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset itself does not generate cash flows that are


-----

31

independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to
which the asset belongs.

The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An
impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised
for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income
immediately.

**_03.07._** **_Inventories_**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and,
where applicable, direct labour costs and overheads incurred in bringing the inventories to their present
location and condition.

Trade discounts, rebates and other similar items are deducted in determining the costs of purchase.

The cost of inventories is calculated by using the weighted average cost formula. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling
and distribution.

The Group assesses the net realisable value of the inventories at year-end and recognises the appropriate
loss if the inventories are overstated. When the circumstances that previously caused inventories to be
written down no longer exist or when there is clear evidence of an increase in net realisable value because
of changed economic circumstances, the amount of the write-down is reversed.

**_03.08._** **_Non-current and other financial assets_**

Except in the case of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets are initially
recognised at fair value, plus any directly attributable transaction costs.

On 1 January 2018, IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” came into force, affecting the classification and
measurement of financial assets, whereby the measurement method is determined on the basis of two
concepts: the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset and the Group’s business model for
managing it. The three new categories for measuring financial assets are: amortised cost, fair value through
other comprehensive income (equity) and fair value through profit or loss.

This classification depends on how an entity manages its financial instruments (equity instruments, loans,
debt securities, etc.), its business model and whether or not there are contractual cash flows from
specifically defined financial assets:

– If the objective of the business model is to hold a financial asset to collect contractual cash flows
and, depending on the terms of the contract, cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest on that principal are received on specified dates, the financial asset is measured at
amortised cost. The Group’s financial assets relate largely to loans and debt securities and are
therefore measured at amortised cost, i.e. initial cost less principal repayments plus accrued interest
receivable on the basis of the effective interest rate, adjusted for any impairment losses recognised,
where applicable.


-----

32

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly matches the initial cost to the total estimated cash
flows for all items over the remaining life of the investment.

Trade receivables arising in the Group’s normal business activities are recognised at their nominal
value adjusted by their lifetime expected credit losses.

– If the objective of the business model is both to collect contractual cash flows and sell financial
assets and, depending on the terms of the contract, cash flows that are solely payments of principal
and interest on that principal are received on specified dates, the financial asset is measured at fair
value through other comprehensive income (equity). Interest, impairment and exchange differences
are recognised in profit or loss as in the amortised cost model. Other changes in fair value are
recognised in equity and are recycled in the consolidated income statement upon their sale.

– Beyond the above scenarios, the general rule is that any other assets are measured at fair value
through profit or loss. This method is used mainly to classify equity instruments, unless they are
initially classified at fair value through other comprehensive income.

However, there are two options for irrevocable designation at initial recognition:

– An equity instrument, provided it is not held for trading purposes, may be designated for
measurement at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity), although if the instrument
is sold, the amounts recognised in equity may not be allocated to the consolidated income
statement and only dividends are recognised in profit or loss.

– A financial asset may also be designated to be measured at fair value through profit or loss if this
reduces or eliminates an accounting mismatch, known as the fair value option.

The Group reclassifies financial assets when it changes the business model for their management.

Expected loss and customer insolvencies

The change as a result of the entry into force of IFRS 9 consists of the change from incurred credit losses to
expected credit losses in the presentation of impaired financial assets. The quantification of expected credit
losses involves determining the probability of default at initial recognition of an asset and, subsequently,
whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis in each reporting period. In
making this assessment, the ACS Group considers both the quantitative and qualitative information that is
reasonable and can be supported, including past experience and forward-looking information that is
available without undue cost or effort. Forward-looking information includes the future prospects of the
industries in which the Group’s debtors operate, obtained from reports compiled by expert economists,
financial analysts, government bodies, relevant groups of experts and other similar organisations, and the
consideration of various external sources of economic forecasts related to the main business operations of
the ACS Group.

In particular, insofar as it is available in a reasonable form, the following information is taken into account for
assessing significant changes in credit risk:

– Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that
are expected to cause a significant change in the borrower’s ability to meet its obligations.

– Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the borrower.

– Significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same borrower.

– Credit ratings assigned by an external agency.

– Significant changes in the value of the collateral supporting the obligation or in the quality of thirdparty guarantees or credit enhancements.

– Significant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the borrower, including changes
in the payment status of borrowers in the Group and changes in the operating results of the
borrower.

– Macroeconomic information, such as market interest rates and growth rates.


-----

33

The Group opted to apply the simplified approach to the impairment of trade receivables that do not contain
a significant financing component, assessing and recognising from the outset the entire expected loss. For
its practical application, estimated calculations are used based on past experience and the risk of each
customer, by geographical area.

As a general rule, impairment is estimated in terms of the expected losses over the next 12 months. When
there is a significant deterioration in credit quality, the expected loss over the life of the asset is estimated.

Current/Non-current classification

Liabilities are classified as current when they are expected to be settled over the course of the Group’s
normal operating cycle, when they are held primarily for the purpose of being traded, when they must be
settled within twelve months after the reporting date, or when the Group does not have an unconditional
right to defer repayment of the liabilities for twelve months after the reporting date.

Derecognition of financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when it expires or when the rights to the cash flows from the
financial asset have been transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial
asset have been transferred, such as in the case of firm asset sales, factoring of trade receivables in which
the Group does not retain any credit or interest rate risk, sales of financial assets under an agreement to
repurchase them at fair value and the securitisation of financial assets in which the transferor does not
retain any subordinated debt, provide any kind of guarantee or assume any other kind of risk.

However, the Group does not derecognise financial assets, and recognises a financial liability for an amount
equal to the consideration received, in transfers of financial assets in which substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership are retained, such as in the case of bill discounting, with-recourse factoring, sales of
financial assets under an agreement to repurchase them at a fixed price or at the selling price plus interest
and the securitisation of financial assets in which the transferor retains a subordinated interest or any other
kind of guarantee that absorbs substantially all the expected losses.

Fair value hierarchies

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified according to the hierarchy established in
IFRS 7, as follows:

Level 1:  Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2:  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3:  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

**_03.09.Non-current assets held for sale, liabilities related to non-current assets held for sale_**

**_and discontinued operations_**

03.09.01. Non-current assets held for sale and liabilities related to non-current assets held for sale

2023

At 31 December 2023, the non-current assets held for sale relate mainly to certain assets corresponding to
the 21.62% of the SH288 highway in Houston (United States) purchased in 2023 (see Note 02.02.f), energy
projects in the process of being sold, such as the off-shore Kinkardine wind farm in Scotland and the Ca-KuA natural gas compression facility in Mexico, and other renewable energy and water assets that the Group
still holds after the sale in 2021 of most of the Industrial Services Division signed with Vinci (see Note
03.09.02).


-----

34

In all the above cases a formal decision was made by the Group to sell these assets, and a plan for their
sale was initiated. These assets are currently available for sale and the sale is expected to be completed
within a period of 12 months from the date of their classification as assets held for sale. It should be noted
that the assets, which were classified as held for sale at 31 December 2023, were held in this category for a
period of more than twelve months, but they were not sold due to certain circumstances, which at the time of
their classification were not likely. Paragraph B1 (c) of appendix B of IFRS 5 exempts a company from using
a one-year period as the maximum period for classifying an asset as held for sale if, during this period,
circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely, the assets were actively marketed at a price
that is reasonable, they fulfil the requirements undertaken by Management and there is a high probability
that the sale will occur within one year from the balance sheet date.

In 2023 the total value of the non-current assets held for sale decreased to EUR 2,471,626 thousand and
the liabilities related to these assets decreased to EUR 1,489,343 thousand. The reduction between 2022
and 2023 is mainly due to the sale of 56.76% of the SH288 highway in Houston, Texas, to Abertis
Infraestructuras, S.A. in December 2023 (see Note 02.02.f), with the consequent loss of control over it and
its exclusion from the scope of consolidation in the Group’s statement of financial position. Another reason
for the decrease was the derecognition of the Hydro Management, S.L. desalination plant given that the
conditions required in the accounting standard to maintain this classification were no longer met.

The breakdown of the assets held for sale and liabilities related to these assets at 31 December 2023 is as

“Other” mainly includes assets related to desalination plants, gas compression plants and transmission lines
related to the Industrial business. In 2023, the entire interest in Ventia that had been reclassified as an asset
held for sale at the beginning of 2023 was sold (see Note 02.02.f).

The ACS Group is currently studying and analysing the various put options or is in the process of selling
them at the expense of obtaining the relevant authorisations and, therefore, has classified these assets
under “Non-current assets held for sale” and “Liabilities related to non-current assets held for sale”.

The amount relating to net debt included under assets held for sale and liabilities related to these assets at
31 December 2023 totalled EUR 1,777,539 thousand (EUR 1,593,715 thousand at 31 December 2022), of
which EUR 693,943 thousand (EUR 678,880 thousand at 31 December 2022) relates to renewable
energies, EUR 494,607 thousand to highways (EUR 479,412 thousand at 31 December 2022) and EUR
588,989 thousand (EUR 435,423 thousand at 31 December 2022) to other assets. The total amount of this
net debt includes EUR 215,920 thousand (EUR 741,236 thousand at 31 December 2022) corresponding to
limited recourse project financing. Net debt is calculated using the arithmetic sum of the current and noncurrent financial liabilities, less long-term deposits, other current financial assets, and cash and cash
equivalents.

2022

At 31 December 2022, the non-current assets held for sale related mainly to the renewable energy and
water assets that the Group still held following the sale of most of the Industrial Services Division to Vinci
(see Note 03.09.02) in 2021, and the SH288 Highway in Houston (United States) of the Concessions
business.

The breakdown of the assets held for sale and liabilities related to these assets at 31 December 2022 was

“Other” included assets related to desalination plants, transmission lines, gas compression plants and
wastewater treatment plants related to the Industrial business and the assets held for sale from Cimic.

Worthy of note in 2022 was the incorporation of the SH288 highway in Houston (United States) (see Note
01.02.f) and the sale of the wind farms of Vientos del Pastorale, S.A. and Parque Eólico Kiyú, S.A. in
Uruguay and the hydroelectric plant Hidromanta in Peru that belong to Spinning Assets, S.L.U. for an
amount equal to EUR 108.0 million in June 2022. In addition, the renewable energy plants of Tonopah in the
United States and Manchasol 1 Central Termosolar Uno, S.L. in Spain were no longer considered to be
assets held for sale because the conditions required by accounting regulations for this classification were
not met.

Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be
recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the assets or
disposal groups must be available for immediate sale in their present condition, and their sale must be
highly probable.

03.09.02. Discontinued operations

**Industrial**

The ACS Group and the Vinci Group signed, effective on 31 December 2021, the public deed of sale for the
majority of the Industrial business of the Group ACS, and given the size of the business being sold —
basically all of ACS’ operations and cash flows in this business that could be separated from the rest of the
Group’s operations — it was decided to recognise the Industrial business being sold to Vinci as a
discontinued operation in 2021 under “Profit after tax from discontinued operations” in the ACS Group’s
income statement.

In addition to the ACS Group receiving EUR 4,902 million in cash as consideration, there was a maximum
earn-out of EUR 600 million in cash at a rate of EUR 20 million for each half GW generated by the Industrial
business sold (up to the “ready to build” stage) between 31 March 2021, and up to 7 years following
execution of the sale, which may be extended for an additional 18 months if the Industrial business sold fails
to generate 6 GW in the first 42 months. At 31 December 2022, the ACS Group updated the valuation
performed in 2021 based on the best information available, bringing the fair value of the earn-out to EUR
329 million (see Note 10.03). Along with other impacts relating to the sale, this gave rise to a profit of EUR
65.3 million under “Profit after tax from discontinued operations” given that, in accordance with IFRS 5.35,
impacts related to the disposal of discontinued operations in a prior period are classified separately in the
information on those discontinued operations. In 2023, EUR 40 million was received for the first GW
generated, and an additional EUR 40 million were received for the second GW generated after the 2023
reporting date (see Note 10.03).

**_03.10._** **_Equity_**

An equity instrument represents a residual interest in the net assets of the Group after deducting all of its
liabilities.

Capital and other equity instruments issued by the Parent are recognised in equity at the proceeds received,
net of direct issue costs.

03.10.01. Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as capital. There are no other types of shares.

Expenses directly attributable to the issue or acquisition of new shares are recognised in equity as a
deduction from the amount of equity.


-----

37

03.10.02. Treasury shares

The transactions involving treasury shares in 2023 and 2022 are summarised in Note 15.04. Treasury
shares were deducted from equity in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position as at 31
December 2023 and 2022.

When the Group acquires or sells treasury shares the amount paid or received for the treasury shares is
recognised directly recognised in equity. No loss or gain from the purchase, sale, issue or retirement of the
Group’s own equity instruments is recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year.

The shares of the Parent Company are measured at average acquisition cost.

03.10.03. Share options

The Group has granted shares and options on ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. shares to
certain employees.

In accordance with IFRS 2, the shares and options granted are considered to be equity-settled share-based
payment transactions. Accordingly, they are measured at fair value at the grant date and are expensed over
the length of the vesting period with a credit to equity, based on the periods of irrevocability of the options.

Since market prices are not available, the value of the shares and share options has been determined using
valuation techniques taking into consideration all factors and conditions that would have been applied in an
arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable parties (Note 28.03).

In addition, the Hochtief Group has granted options on Hochtief, A.G. shares to management members.

**_03.11._** **_Government grants_**

The ACS Group has received grants from various government agencies mainly to finance investments in
property, plant and equipment for its Services business. Evidence of compliance with the conditions
established in the related grant resolutions was provided to the relevant competent agencies, and they are
recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions associated with their award have been
met and that they will be received.

Government grants received by the Group to acquire assets are taken to income over the same period and
on the same basis as those used to depreciate the asset relating to this grant.

Government grants to compensate costs are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the
periods in which the Group recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to
compensate.

A government grant receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose
of giving financial support with no future related costs is recognised in profit or loss of the period in which it
becomes receivable.

**_03.12._** **_Financial liabilities_**

Financial liabilities are classified in accordance with the content and the substance of the contractual
arrangements.

The main financial liabilities held by the Group companies relate to held-to-maturity financial liabilities, which
are measured at amortised cost.

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the obligations giving rise to them cease to exist.

The financial risk management policies of the ACS Group are detailed in Note 21.


-----

38

03.12.01. Debentures, loans and debt securities

Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue
costs. Finance costs, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are
recognised in profit or loss on an accrual basis using the effective interest method and are added to the
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.

Exchanges of debt instruments between the Group and the counterparty or substantial changes in the
liabilities initially recognised are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original liability and the
recognition of a new financial liability, provided the instruments have substantially different terms. The Group
considers that the terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under
the new terms, including any fees paid net of any fees received and discounted using the original effective
interest rate, is at least ten per cent different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows
of the original financial liability. Therefore, the Group considers only fees paid or received by the lender,
including fees paid or received by the Group or the lender on behalf of the counterparty.

Where an exchange is recognised as an extinguishment of the original financial liability, the costs or fees are
recognised in the consolidated income statement. Otherwise, the modified flows are discounted at the
original effective interest rate, and any difference from the previous carrying amount is recognised in profit or
loss. Similarly, the costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the financial liability and are
amortised using the amortised cost method over the remaining term of the modified financial liability.

Debentures and other marketable securities, loans and credit facilities are subsequently measured at
amortised cost.

Loans are classified as current items unless the Group has the unconditional right to defer repayment of the
debt for at least 12 months from the end of the reporting period.

03.12.02. Trade and other payables

Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value, which does not differ
significantly from their fair value.

“Trade payables” also includes the balances payable to suppliers through reverse factoring agreements with
financial institutions, provided that the cost is borne by the Group and there is no possibility of recourse to
the supplier in the event of non-payment. In addition, the payments related to these agreements are also
classified as cash flows from operations since these transactions do not include either specific guarantees
provided as pledges on the payments to be made or any changes that alter the commercial nature of the
transactions.

In those reverse factoring transactions where the Group benefits from an additional deferral and does not
bear any costs, the balances remitted are recognised under “Other current liabilities”.

03.12.03. Current/Non-current classification

In the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position debts due to be settled within 12 months
are classified as current items and those due to be settled within more than 12 months as non-current items.

Loans due within 12 months but whose long-term refinancing is assured at the Group’s discretion, through
existing long-term credit loan facilities, are classified as non-current liabilities.

“Project finance with limited recourse” is classified based on the same criteria, and the detail is shown in
Note 18.

39

03.12.04. Retirement benefit obligations

**a.** **Post-employment benefit obligations**

Certain Group companies have post-employment benefit obligations of various kinds to their employees.
These obligations are classified by group of employees and may relate to defined contribution or defined
benefit plans.

For defined contributions, the contributions made are recognised as expenditure under “Personnel
expenses” in the consolidated income statement as they accrue.

ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. includes in defined benefit plans for Spanish companies
those financed through the payment of insurance premiums in which there is a legal or constructive
obligation to pay the employees the promised benefits when they become claimable. This obligation is
fulfilled through the insurance company.

ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. is required, under specific conditions, to make monthly
payments to a group of employees to supplement the mandatory public social security system benefits for
retirement, permanent disability, death of spouse or death of parent.

As regards defined benefit plans, actuarial studies are conducted once a year by independent experts using
market assumptions and the expenditure relating to the obligations is recognised on an accrual basis,
classifying the normal cost for the current employees over their working lives under “Personnel expenses”
and recognising the associated finance cost, in the event that the obligation were to be financed, by
applying the rates relating to investment-grade bonds on the basis of the obligation recognised at the
beginning of each year (see Note 20).

The post-employment benefit obligations include, among others, those arising from certain companies of the
Hochtief Group, for which the Group has recognised the related liabilities and whose recognition criteria are
explained in Note 03.13.

**b.** **Other employee benefit obligations**

The expense relating to termination benefits is recognised in full when there is an agreement or when the
interested parties have a valid expectation that such an agreement will be reached that will enable the
employees, individually or collectively and unilaterally or by mutual agreement with the company, to cease
working for the Group in exchange for a termination benefit. If a mutual agreement is required, a provision is
only recognised in situations in which the Group considers that it will give its consent to the termination of
the employees.

03.12.05. Termination benefits

Under current law, Spanish consolidated companies and certain foreign companies are required to pay
termination benefits to employees terminated without just cause. There are no employee redundancy plans
making it necessary to record a provision in this connection.

**_03.13._** **_Provisions_**

The Group’s Consolidated Annual Accounts include all the material provisions with respect to which it is
considered that it is more likely than not that the obligation will have to be settled. Contingent liabilities are
not recognised in the Consolidated Annual Accounts, but rather are disclosed, as required by IAS 37.

Provisions, which are quantified on the basis of the best information available on the consequences of the
event giving rise to them and are reviewed and adjusted at the end of each year, are used to cater for the
specific obligations for which they were originally recognised. Provisions are fully or partially reversed when
such obligations cease to exist or are reduced.


-----

40

Litigation and/or claims in process

At the end of 2023 certain litigation and claims were in process against the consolidated companies forming
part of the ACS Group arising from the ordinary course of their operations. The Group’s legal advisers and
directors consider that the outcome of litigation and claims will not have a material effect on the annual
accounts for the years in which they are settled.

Provisions for employee termination benefit costs

Pursuant to current law, a provision is recognised to meet the cost of termination of temporary employees
with a contract for project work.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations

In the case of foreign companies whose post-employment benefit obligations are not externalised, the
provisions for pensions and similar obligations most notably include those recognised by various Hochtief
Group companies, as explained below.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognised for current and future benefit payments to
active and former employees and their surviving dependants. The obligations primarily relate to pension
benefits, partly for basic pensions and partly for optional supplementary pensions. The individual benefit
obligations vary from one country to another and are determined for the most part by length of service and
pay scales. Turner’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired employees are likewise included in the
provisions for pensions due to their pension-like nature.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. This
determines the present value of future entitlements, taking into account current and future benefits already
known at the reporting date plus anticipated future increases in salaries and pensions and, for the Turner
Group, in healthcare costs. The calculation is based on actuarial appraisals using biometric accounting
principles. As defined in IAS 19, plan assets are shown separately as deductions from the pension
obligations. Plan assets comprise assets transferred to pension funds to meet pension obligations, shares in
investment funds purchased under deferred compensation arrangements and qualifying insurance policies
in the form of pension liability insurance. If the fair value of the plan assets is greater than the present value
of the employee benefits, the difference is reported—subject to the limit in IAS 19—under “Non-current
assets.”

Amounts arising from the assessments of the defined benefit plans are recognised directly in the
consolidated income statement during the period in which they arise. The current cost for the year is
recognised under personnel expenses. The effect of interest on the increase in pension obligations, reduced
by expected returns on plan assets (each calculated using the discount factor method for pension
obligations), is reported in net investment and finance income.

Provisions for project completion

This corresponds to the estimated costs for site clearance and other expenses that may be incurred from
completion of the project until its final settlement, which are accrued over the execution period on the basis
of production volumes and are recognised under “Current provisions” on the liability side of the consolidated
statements of financial position.

Decommissioning of fixed assets

The Group is obliged to decommission certain facilities at the end of their useful life at their location. The
corresponding provisions have been made for this purpose and the present value of the cost of carrying out
these tasks has been estimated, recognising an asset as a balancing entry.

Other provisions

Other provisions include mainly provisions for warranty costs.

**_03.14._** **_Risk management policy_**

The ACS Group is exposed to certain risks that it manages by applying risk identification, measurement,
concentration limitation and monitoring systems.

The main principles defined by the ACS Group for its risk management policy are as follows:

– Compliance with corporate governance rules.

– Establishment by the Group’s various lines of business and companies of the risk
management controls required to ensure that market transactions are performed in
accordance with the policies, standards and procedures of the ACS Group.

– Special attention to the management of financial risk, basically including interest rate risk,
foreign currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk (see Note 21).

The ACS Group’s risk management is of a preventative nature and is aimed at the medium and long term,
taking into account the most probable scenarios with respect to the future changes in the variables affecting
each risk.

**_03.15._** **_Financial derivatives_**

The ACS Group’s activities are exposed to financial risks, mainly involving changes in foreign exchange
rates and interest rates. The transactions performed are in line with the risk management policy defined by
the Group.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is signed and
are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date. Subsequent changes in fair value are
recognised depending on whether the derivative has been designated as a hedging instrument and, if it has,
on the nature of the item being hedged.

A financial derivative is a financial instrument or other contract whose value varies in response to changes in
certain variables, such as an interest rate, financial instrument price, foreign exchange rate, credit rating or
credit index or any other variable, which may be of a non-financial nature.

Apart from giving rise to gains or losses, financial derivatives may, under certain conditions, fully or partially
offset foreign currency or interest rate risks or risks associated with balances and transactions. Hedges are
accounted for as follows:

– Cash flow hedges: in hedges of this type, the changes in value of the hedging instrument
determined to be effective are recognised provisionally in equity and are taken to income when the
hedged item materialises, and if ineffective, they are recognised in profit or loss.

– Fair value hedges: in this case, if ineffective, the changes in value of the hedging instrument are
recognised in profit or loss, and the changes in value of the hedged item adjusted by the hedged
risk are also recognised in profit or loss, and if effective, they are recognised in equity.

– Hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation: the purpose of this type of hedging transaction is
to hedge foreign currency risk and they are accounted for as hedges and recognised in the same
way as cash flow hedges.

In accordance with IFRS 9 “Financial instruments,” an efficiency test must be carried out, consisting of a
assessment of the financial derivative to determine if it can be considered a hedging instrument and,
therefore, effective.

The requirements that should be met are as follows:

– Formal designation and documentation, at inception of the hedge, of the hedging relationship and
the entity’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.


-----

42

– Documentation identifying the hedged item, the hedging instrument and the nature of the risk being
hedged.

– It must meet the effectiveness requirements, i.e., there is an economic relationship between the
hedged item and the hedging instrument so that both generally move in directions opposite to the
hedged risk. Likewise, credit risk should not have a dominant effect on changes in value of the
hedged items and the hedge ratio should be equivalent to the percentage of exposure to the risk
hedged.

According to the qualitative effectiveness test, hedging will be considered effective as long as it meets these
criteria. If this were not the case, the hedge would cease to be treated as such, the hedging relationship
would be discontinued and the derivative would be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.

Once the effectiveness of the instruments has been assessed, a quantitative analysis will be used to
determine how they will be recognised. This quantitative analysis consists of a retrospective part, purely for
accounting purposes, and a prospective part with the objective of analysing possible future deviations in the
hedging relationship.

For the retrospective assessment, the analysis is adapted to the type of hedge and the nature of the
instruments used:

– In cash flow hedges, as regards interest rate swaps (IRS) in which the Group receives a floating
rate equal to that of the hedged financing and pays a fixed rate, since the objective is to reduce the
variability of financing costs, the effectiveness is estimated using a test that determines whether
changes in the fair value of the IRS cash flows offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged
risk.

The difference between the value of the change recognised in equity and the fair value of the derivative at
the date on which the effectiveness test is being prepared will be considered the ineffective portion and will
be recognised directly in the income statement.

For cash flow hedges in which the hedging derivative instrument is not an IRS but an option or a forward,
we must differentiate between the designated portion and the non-designated portion:

– The treatment of the designated portion will be similar to that detailed for the IRS.

– For the non-designated portion (forward points or temporary value of the options), the change in its
fair value will be recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that it relates to the
hedged item and will be accumulated in a separate component of equity. This amount will be
reclassified from the separate component of equity to profit or loss for the period as a
reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future
cash flows affect profit or loss for the period (for example, when a forecast sale occurs).

Changes in the fair value of financial derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in
the income statement as they arise.

The measurement is carried out through methods and techniques determined using observable market
inputs, such as:

– The IRSs were measured by discounting all the flows envisaged in each contract on the basis of its
characteristics, such as the notional amount and the collection and payment schedule. This
measurement was made using the zero-coupon rate curve determined by employing a
bootstrapping process for the deposits and swaps traded at any given time. This zero-coupon rate
curve was used to obtain the discount factors for the measurements, which were made assuming
the absence of arbitrage opportunity (AAO). When the derivatives include caps and floors or
combinations of them, on occasions conditional upon special conditions being met, the interest rates
used were the same as those used for the swaps, although to introduce the component of
randomness in the exercise of the options, the generally accepted Black-Scholes model was used.

– In the case of a cash flow hedging derivative tied to inflation, the method used is very similar to that
applied to interest rate swaps. The projected inflation is estimated on the basis of the inflation


-----

43

included implicitly in the ex-tobacco European inflation-indexed swaps quoted on the market and is
aligned with Spanish inflation by means of a convergence adjustment.

Equity swaps are measured as the result of the difference between the quoted price at year end and the
strike price initially agreed upon, multiplied by the number of contracts reflected in the swap.

Derivatives where the underlying asset is quoted on an organised market and that are not qualified as
hedges are measured using the Black-Scholes model and applying market parameters such as implicit
volatility and estimated dividends.

For those derivatives where the underlying asset is quoted on an organised market, but in which the
derivative forms part of a financing agreement and where its arrangement substitutes the underlying asset,
the measurement is based on the calculation of its intrinsic value at the calculation date.

Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate
derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and
provided the host contracts are not measured at fair value by recognising changes in fair value in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The fair value includes the measurement of the credit risk of the counterparty in the case of assets, or of the
ACS Group’s own risk in the case of liabilities, in accordance with the IFRS 13. Therefore, when a derivative
presents unrealised gains, this amount is adjusted downward according to the risk of the banking
counterparty due to make payment to a Group company, whereas when there are unrealised losses, this
amount is reduced on the basis of own credit risk, as it will be the Group company that will be required to
pay the counterparty.

The assessment of own and counterparty risk takes into account the existence of contractual guarantees
(collateral), which can be used to offset a credit loss in the event of suspension of payments.

For derivatives with unrealised losses, the own credit risk applied to adjust the market price is that of each
individual company or project assessed and not the Group or sub-group to which they belong. To do so, an
internal rating is prepared for each company/project using objective parameters such as financial ratios,
indicators, etc.

For derivatives with unrealised gains, since accounting standards do not provide a specific methodology that
should be applied, an accepted “best practice” method has been used, which takes three elements into
account to calculate the adjustment to obtain the result by multiplying the level of exposure in the position by
the probability of default and by any loss in the event of non-compliance.

In addition, a sensitivity test is carried out on the derivatives and net financial debt to be able to analyse the
effect that a possible fluctuation in interest rates might have on the Group’s accounts, under the assumption
of an increase and a decrease in the rates at year end in different variation scenarios (see Note 21). The
procedure is similar in the case of changes in exchange rates.

Meanwhile, any gains or losses on fair value for credit risk of derivatives are recognised in the consolidated
income statement when the derivatives are qualified as speculative (non-hedging); if the derivatives are
classified as hedging instruments and recognised directly in equity, then the gains or losses on fair value are
also recognised in equity.

Financial instruments measured after their initial recognition at fair value are classified into levels 1 to 3
based on the degree to which fair value is observable (see Note 21).

Note 22 to these accompanying Consolidated Annual Accounts details the financial derivatives that the ACS
Group has arranged, among other related aspects.

Interbank Interest Rate Reform

The Group maintains various hedging relationships with hedging instruments and hedged items where the
interest rate benchmark is the SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) or the Euribor. These benchmark
interest rates have been reformed and, therefore, the Group has assessed the potential impact on the
financial statements and concluded that they will not have a material impact.

**_03.16._** **_Revenue recognition_**

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the goods received
and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.

Revenue and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis, i.e., when the actual flow of the related goods
and services occurs, regardless of when the resulting monetary or financial flow arises.

Interest income is accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the
effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts over
the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s carrying amount.

Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholder’s rights to receive payment have
been established.

Pursuant to IFRS 15, the Group identifies and separates the various commitments to transfer a good or
service under a contract. This implies recognising separately the revenue from each of the obligations that
could be individually identified within the same host contract.

The Group also estimates the price of each of the contracts that have been identified taking into account, in
addition to the initial price agreed in the contract, the amount of the variable consideration and the time
value of money (where a significant financing component is considered) and non-cash considerations.

In those cases where the amount is variable or in line with claims not approved, the amount is estimated
using the approach that best predicts the amount to which the Group will be entitled, using either a
probability-based expected value or the single most likely amount. This consideration will only be recognised
to the extent that it is considered highly likely that a significant reversal of recognised revenue will not occur
when the associated uncertainty is resolved.

Certain particular features of the business activities carried on by the Group, such as revenue from the
construction business, are detailed as follows:

Revenue:

Due to the nature of the activity, its revenue usually comes from long-term contracts where the start date
and end date of the contract’s activity are generally in different accounting periods, therefore the initial
estimates of income and expenses may be subject to variations that could affect the recognition of revenue,
expenses and profit or loss.

The Group recognises the revenue from construction contracts in accordance with the percentage of
completion method, whereby the percentage of completion is estimated either by reference to the stage of
completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date, determined based on an examination of the
work performed, or on the basis of the percentage of costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs.
In the first case, based on the measurement of the units completed, the work performed is recognised in
each period as revenue and the costs are recognised on an accrual basis corresponding to the units
completed. In the second case, revenue is recognised in the income statement based on the stage of
completion measured in terms of costs incurred (the costs incurred versus the total estimated costs in the
contract), applied to the total project revenue that is considered highly likely to be obtained from the project.
The latter is common in markets with an Anglo-Saxon influence and contracts without unit prices.


-----

45

In some circumstances (for example, in the early stages of a contract), the Group may not be able to
reasonably measure the outcome with a performance obligation, even if the Group expects to recover the
costs incurred in satisfying the performance obligation. In those circumstances, the Group recognises
revenue from ordinary activities only to the extent of the costs incurred until such time that it can reasonably
measure the outcome of the performance obligation.

Also, in contracts where the estimated costs of a contract are considered to exceed the revenue from the
contract, a provision is recognised for the expected losses with a charge to the consolidated income
statement for the year in which they arise.

Contract revenue is recognised considering the initial amount of the contract agreed with the customer, and
modifications and claims on the contract to the extent that it is highly probable that income will be obtained
from the contract, which can be reliably measured and does not imply a significant reversal in the future.

A contract modification is considered to exist when there is an instruction from the customer to change the
scope of the contract. A claim is considered to exist on contracts when costs not included in the initial
contract are incurred by the customer or third parties (delays, errors in specifications or design, etc.) and the
contractor has the right to be compensated for the overruns incurred either by the customer or by the third
party from whom the overruns originated.

These modifications and claims are included as revenue from the contract when the customer has approved
the related work, either in writing, by verbal agreement or implied by customary business practices, i.e.
when payment is considered highly probable and there will be no significant reversal of revenue in the
future.

In cases where the works are approved but not yet priced or where, although customer approval has not yet
been obtained, the Group considers that final approval is highly likely due to negotiations having reached an
advanced stage or as a result of internal technical and/or legal reports or reports from independent experts
that support it, the amount to be recognised as revenue is estimated in accordance with the definition of
“variable consideration” set out in IFRS 15, i.e. using those methods that better predict the amount of the
consideration so that the most likely amount is obtained (a single most likely amount in a range of possible
consideration amounts), taking into account all available information (historical, current and forecast) that is
reasonably available and only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount
of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable
consideration is subsequently resolved.

As mentioned previously, construction contracts are subject to estimates of revenue and costs that need to
be reviewed by project managers as the projects progress. Any modification of the estimates of revenue,
expenses and the final profit or loss of the work is subject to revision by the various levels of upper
management and when they are verified and approved, the effect is treated as a change in the accounting
estimate in the year in which it occurs and in subsequent periods, in accordance with the accounting
regulations in force.

Expenses:

Project costs include those directly related to the host contract and any modifications or claims associated
with the contract. They also include those costs related to the procurement activity of each contract, such as
insurance, consultants, design and technical assistance, etc.

These costs are recognised on an accrual basis, with the costs related to the completed units of work and
the total indirect costs of the contract attributable to them being recognised as an expense.

Those expenses related to future contract activity, such as insurance premiums, work facilities, consultants,
design and other preliminary work, are initially recognised as assets under “Inventories” — provided they
are considered necessary for the performance of the contract and that they will be recovered with
performance of the contract —, and are taken to the income statement in accordance with the percentage of
completion of the contract.


-----

46

Machinery removal and site installation dismantling costs, upkeep costs within the guarantee period and the
costs, if any, arising in the period from the completion of the construction work to the date of final settlement
are accrued over the life of the construction project, as they take into account more of the cost of the work
and relate to both the completed units of work and the future activity of the contract.

As regards the depreciation of fixed assets involved in performance of the contract, those assets with an
estimated useful life that coincides with the contractual term are depreciated throughout performance of the
contract so that they are fully depreciated upon completion. For machinery with a useful life that exceeds the
contractual term, the depreciation charge is distributed on the basis of technical criteria among the different
contracts to which it will be assigned and it is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the course of each
contract.

Late-payment interest resulting from a delay in the payment of progress billings by the customer is
recognised as finance income only when it can be reliably measured and its collection is reasonably
assured.

The Group companies recognise the positive difference between the contract revenue recognised and the
amount related to the progress billings from this contract under “Completed work pending certification”
under “Trade and other receivables”. They also recognise the amount of advance billings for various items,
including advances received from the customer, under “Advances received on orders” under “Trade and
other payables”.

03.16.01. Construction activities

In construction contracts, as a general rule a single performance obligation is identified due to the high
degree of integration and customisation of the different goods and services to offer a joint product, which is
transferred to the customer over time.

As indicated above, the method chosen by the ACS Group as the preferred method is the “measured unit of
work” based on the output method, which is applied provided the progress of the work carried out can be
measured during execution and there is an allocation of prices to each unit of work.

The input method known as “stage of completion measured in terms of costs incurred” can only be applied
in those contracts where it is not possible to determine the unit price of the units to be completed.

In this case, revenue is recognised in the income statement based on the stage of completion measured in
terms of costs incurred (costs incurred versus total estimated costs in the contract), applied to the total
project revenue that is considered highly likely to be obtained from the project.

03.16.02. Services and other activities

In this case there is no single type of contract due to the wide variety of services provided. In general,
contracts include various tasks and unit prices where revenue is are recognised in the income statement
when services are provided on a time elapsed basis, i.e., when the customer simultaneously receives and
consumes the benefits provided by the performance of the service as it occurs. This is the case, for
example, for recurring or routine services such as facilities management, cleaning, etc.

Certain contracts include different types of activities that are subject to fixed unit price tables for the
provision of the services that are delivered and that form part of the complete contract. The customer
requests each service through work orders that are considered an independent performance obligation and
the associated revenue is recognised depending on the specific requirements established in the contract for
approval.

For complex long-term contracts that include the provision of various services involving different
performance obligations (construction, maintenance, operation, etc.), where payment is made periodically
and the price corresponding to these obligations is indicated in the contract or can be determined, revenue
is recognised for the recurring services using the time elapsed method and the stage of completion method


-----

47

for more complex performance obligations where it is not possible to assign prices to each of the units
completed.

**_3.17._** **_Expense recognition_**

An expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement when there is a decrease in the future
economic benefits related to a reduction of an asset, or an increase in a liability, which can be measured
reliably. This means that an expense is recognised simultaneously to the recognition of the increase in a
liability or the reduction of an asset.

Additionally, an expense is recognised immediately when a disbursement does not give rise to future
economic benefits or when the requirements for recognition as an asset are not met.

Also, an expense is recognised when a liability is incurred and no asset is recognised, as in the case of a
liability relating to a guarantee.

**_03.18._** **_Offsetting_**

Asset and liability balances must be offset and the net amount is presented in the consolidated statement of
financial position when, and only when, they arise from transactions in which, contractually or by law,
offsetting is permitted and the Group companies intend to settle them on a net basis, or to realise the asset
and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences are
offset at year-end if they relate to the same jurisdiction and are consistent in nature and maturity. The ACS
Group offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if, and only if, the entity:

(a) has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and
(b) intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously.

**_03.19._** **_Income tax_**

The income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and the change in deferred tax
assets and liabilities.

The current income tax expense is calculated by aggregating the current tax arising from the application of
the tax rate to the taxable profit (tax loss) for the year, after deducting the tax credits allowable for tax
purposes, plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities include temporary differences measured at the amount expected to be
payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax
bases, and tax loss and tax credit carryforwards. These amounts are measured at the tax rates that are
expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, unless the temporary difference
arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition (except in the case of a business
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither accounting profit (loss) nor
taxable profit (tax loss).

Deferred tax assets are recognised for temporary differences to the extent that it is considered probable that
the consolidated companies will have sufficient taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax
asset can be utilised, and the deferred tax assets do not arise from the initial recognition (except in a
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither accounting profit
(loss) nor taxable profit (tax loss). The other deferred tax assets (tax loss and tax credit carryforwards) are
only recognised when it is probable that the consolidated companies will have sufficient taxable profits in the
future against which they can be utilised.


-----

48

The deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised are reassessed at the end of each reporting period to
ascertain whether they still exist and the appropriate adjustments are made based on the findings of the
analyses performed. Deferred tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences are offset at year-end if
they relate to the same jurisdiction and are consistent in nature and maturity.

The Spanish companies more than 75% owned by the Parent Company file consolidated tax returns, as part
of Tax Group 30/99, in accordance with current law.

Tax uncertainties

If the Group determines that the tax authority is not likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment or a group of
uncertain tax treatments, it considers this uncertainty in the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax
bases, tax loss carryforwards, tax credits or tax rates. The Group determines the effect of the uncertainty on
the corporate income tax return using the expected value method when the range of possible outcomes is
highly dispersed, or the most likely amount method when the outcome is binary or concentrated on one
value. In cases where the tax asset or liability calculated using these methods exceeds the amount reported
in the self-assessments, this amount is recognised as current or non-current in the consolidated statement
of financial position based on the expected date of recovery or settlement, whereas the amount of any late
payment interest on the liability is recognised in the income statement as it accrues. The Group recognises
changes in facts and circumstances regarding tax uncertainties as a change in estimates.

**_03.20._** **_Earnings per share_**

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit attributable to the Parent Company by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding the average number of
shares of the Parent Company held by the Group companies (see Note 31.01).

Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders
adjusted by the effect attributable to the dilutive potential ordinary shares by the weighted average number
of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted by the weighted average number of ordinary shares
that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all the potential ordinary shares into ordinary
shares of the Parent Company. For these purposes, it is considered that the shares are converted at the
beginning of the year or at the date of issue of the potential ordinary shares, if the latter were issued during
the current period (see Note 31.02).

The execution of the share plan and the ACS share option plan currently in force at 31 December 2023 (see
Note 28.03) does not involve the issuance of new shares in the future and, therefore, does not affect diluted
earnings per share. At 31 December 2023, as a result of the simultaneous share capital increase and
reduction decided in 2023 for the same number of shares, basic earnings and diluted earnings per share for
continuing operations for the first half of 2023 are the same.

**_03.21._** **_Foreign currency transactions_**

The euro is the presentation currency of the Group’s Consolidated Annual Accounts. Therefore, transactions
in currencies other than the euro are considered to be “foreign currency transactions” and are recognised by
applying the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.

Foreign currency transactions are initially recognised in the functional currency of the Group by applying the
exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.

At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to
euros at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are measured in
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction.


-----

49

The exchange rates of the main currencies in which the ACS Group operates in 2023 and 2022 are as
follows:

|Col1|Average exchange rate|Col3|Closing exchange rate|Col5|
|---|---|---|---|---|
||2023|2022|2023|2022|
|1 U.S. Dollar (USD) 1 Australian Dollar (AUD) 1 Polish Zloty (PLN) 1 Canadian Dollar (CAD) 1 British Pound (GBP)|0.923 0.612 0.221 0.686 1.152|0.952 0.660 0.213 0.729 1.170|0.905 0.615 0.231 0.684 1.154|0.938 0.637 0.213 0.691 1.131|


**Average exchange rate** **Closing exchange rate**

**2023** **2022** **2023** **2022**

1 U.S. Dollar (USD) 0.923 0.952 0.905 0.938

1 Australian Dollar (AUD) 0.612 0.660 0.615 0.637

1 Polish Zloty (PLN) 0.221 0.213 0.231 0.213

1 Canadian Dollar (CAD) 0.686 0.729 0.684 0.691

1 British Pound (GBP) 1.152 1.170 1.154 1.131


All exchange rates are in euros.

Any exchange differences arising on settlement or translation at the closing rates of monetary items are
recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year, except for those arising on items that form
part of an investment in a foreign operation, which are recognised directly in equity net of taxes until the
date of disposal.

On certain occasions, in order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign currency risks, the Group enters into
forward currency contracts and options (see Note 21 for details of the Group’s accounting policies in respect
of such derivative financial instruments).

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated to euros at the
exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the
average exchange rates for the year, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Any translation
differences arising are classified as equity. These translation differences are recognised as income or as
expenses in the period in which the investment is made or disposed of.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a company with a currency other than the
euro are treated as assets and liabilities of that company and are translated at the closing rate.

**_03.22._** **_Entities and branches located in hyperinflationary economies_**

In 2023 and 2022, the Group did not carry out any relevant activities in countries with hyperinflationary
economies, such as Argentina and Venezuela, and therefore the impact has not been significant for the ACS
Group.

None of the functional currencies of the consolidated subsidiaries and associates located abroad relate to
hyperinflationary economies as defined by International Financial Reporting Standards. Accordingly, at the
2023 and 2022 accounting close it was not necessary to adjust the financial statements of any of the
subsidiaries or associates to correct for the effect of inflation.

**_03.23._** **_Consolidated statement of cash flows_**

The following terms are used in the consolidated statements of cash flows with the meanings specified:

– Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid
investments that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

– Operating activities: the principal revenue-producing activities of the Group and other activities that
are not investing or financing activities.

– Investing activities: the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not
included in cash and cash equivalents.

– Financing activities: activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the equity and
liabilities that are not operating activities.


-----

50

In view of the diversity of its businesses and activities, the Group opted to report cash flows using the
indirect method.

In preparing the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents were considered to be
cash on hand, demand deposits at banks and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

The breakdown of “Other adjustments to profit (net)” in the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2023
and 2022 is as follows:

**Total** **284,555** **169,947**


In preparing the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2023 and 2022, the acquisitions of ACS treasury
shares were included under “Equity instrument proceeds/(and payment)” in the section on cash flows from
financing activities (see Note 15.04). In addition, in 2023, cash outflows from the purchase of shares of
Hochtief, A.G. amounting to EUR 462.3 million were considered as cash flows from financing activities. In
2022, these cash outflows included the amount of the Hochtief 10% capital increase and the subsequent
purchases by Hochtief of EUR 543.1 million as well as the cash outflows resulting from Hochtief’s takeover
bid to acquire the remaining shares of Cimic for AUD 1,500 million (EUR 985 million) (see Note 20.01).

The payments made in 2023 by Hochtief for the settlement of the CCPP project in Australia and the
payments made to settle the litigation involving Radials 3 and 5 amounting to a total EUR 233 million were
recognised under “Other financing activity proceeds and payables” in the statement of cash flows (see Note
20.01). This same heading included the payments made in 2022 by Hochtief in the amount of EUR 278
million for the settlement of the first instalment on the CCPP project in Australia, the final payment for the
Chilean Alto Maipo project, and the legal costs and finance expenses arising from the litigation relating to
the closure of the Seattle project (see Note 29.c).

In relation to cash flows, in accordance with IFRS 16.50, cash payments for the interest portion of the lease
liability are still classified as financing activities by applying the same alternative as permitted by IAS 7.33
Statement of Cash Flows in force for financial interest.

The reconciliation of the carrying amount of the liabilities arising from financing activities, separately

The amount corresponding to reclassifications at 31 December 2022 mainly included the reclassification of
the debt arising from the full consolidation of the SH288 highway to non-current assets held for sale and
liabilities related to non-current assets held for sale (see Notes 02.02.f and 03.09.01). The changes in the
scope of consolidation and others at 31 December 2023 include the impact of the deconsolidation of the
SH288 following the sale of 56.76% to Abertis Infraestructuras, which was recognised as a non-current
asset held for sale, and the debt corresponding to Hydro Management, S.L. (see Note 03.09.01). At 31
December 2022, this heading mainly included the change in net debt resulting from the sale of the noncurrent assets held for sale of the Industrial business.

Due to the relationship with certain Hochtief Group companies, the new IFRS 17 “Insurance contracts”
replaced the previous IFRS 4 “Insurance contracts” in its entirety as of 1 January 2023. The standard is
relevant for these companies in relation to the non-life insurance business mainly due to their reinsurance
activity for insured construction risks.

Insurance contracts are measured using the building block approach in which the estimated present value
includes all expected discounted future cash flows, including an explicit risk adjustment and a contractual
service margin. The contractual service margin represents the unearned profit that will be recognised in the
future during the period in which the insurance contract services are provided. The measurement of
insurance items, such as liabilities for insurance claims, typically takes into account all cash flows arising
from the rights and obligations of an insurance contract. As a result, some items that were separately
disclosed under IFRS 4 in our consolidated financial statements, such as deferred income comprising
insurance premiums received in advance for subsequent periods, are omitted.

The Group has chosen the modified retrospective approach for the transition to IFRS 17. The initial
application of IFRS 17 has not had a significant effect on the transition considering the ACS Group’s
consolidated financial statements as a whole. Its effect on the consolidated income statement was EUR 12.5
million and EUR 17.3 million in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 2023. Under this
approach, the figures presented for the comparative period remain unchanged as does the opening balance
of the consolidated statement of financial position for the year.

The overlay approach applied to certain marketable securities held by our insurance companies, which
previously allowed for fair value adjustments through other comprehensive income, ended with the
introduction of IFRS 17. There were no significant effects on profit or loss as a result of the measurement of
these marketable securities through profit or loss.

In relation to other previous standards, the ACS Group applied the standards in 2023 but they did not have a
significant impact on the figures or the presentation and disclosure of the information, either because they

did not entail any significant changes or because they refer to economic events that do not affect the ACS
Group.

In accordance with the table above, the most significant goodwill is the result of the full consolidation of
Hochtief, A.G., amounting to EUR 1,144,226 thousand at 31 December 2023 (EUR 1,144,226 thousand at
31 December 2022), and the result of the merger of the Parent Company with Grupo Dragados, S.A., which
amounted to EUR 554,420 thousand at 31 December 2023 (EUR 554,420 thousand at 31 December 2022).

There were no significant changes in 2023. There were no significant changes in 2022, except for the
addition and subsequent transfer to non-current assets held for sale of the goodwill relating to the SH288
highway explained in Note 03.09.01.

As regards goodwill, as a general rule on 30 September each year, the ACS Group compares the carrying
amount of the company or cash-generating unit (CGU) against its value in use, determined using the
discounted cash flow method. The amounts were restated on 30 September in accordance with its
accounting policy. There have been no significant changes in the assumptions used when testing the
Group’s goodwill for impairment that could give rise to a significant risk of recognising an impairment loss in
the future. It should be noted that the market price of the holding in Hochtief (EUR 100.30 per share at 31
December 2023) is higher than its carrying amount.

As regards the goodwill generated by the purchase of Hochtief, A.G. in 2011, in accordance with IAS 36.80,
this goodwill was allocated to the main cash-generating units, namely Hochtief Asia Pacific and Hochtief
Americas. The goodwill allocated to the business carried out by Hochtief Asia Pacific amounts to EUR 857
million (EUR 857 million at 31 December 2022), while EUR 287 million is allocated to the Hochtief Americas
business (EUR 287 million at 31 December 2022). In 2023 and 2022, the ACS Group assessed the
recoverability of this goodwill.

In preparing the impairment test of Hochtief’s goodwill allocated to the business carried out by Hochtief Asia
Pacific, the ACS Group used the following basic assumptions:

– Five-year forecasts used based on internal estimates.

– Weighted perpetual growth rate of 2.49% (2.53% in 2022).

– Weighted discount rate of 11.32% (11.99% in 2022). The discount rate used represents a premium
of 662 basis points over the return on the long-term interest rate (10-year bond weighted based on
the countries in which it operates) published by Bloomberg on 30 September 2023.

As for the sensitivity analysis of the impairment test on the goodwill allocated to Hochtief’s Asia Pacific
business, the most relevant aspects are that the goodwill test would withstand a discount rate of
approximately 15.15%, representing a range of approximately 383 basis points. Furthermore, it would
withstand an annual drop in cash flows of approximately 43% compared to projected cash flows.

In the case of the Hochtief Americas business, the following basic assumptions were made:

– Five-year forecasts used based on internal estimates.

– Perpetual growth rate of 2.1% (2.3% in 2022).

– Discount rate of 9.29% (9.52% in 2022).


-----

55

As for the sensitivity analysis of the impairment test on the goodwill allocated to Hochtief’s Americas
business, the most relevant aspects are that the goodwill test, even assuming a cash position of zero euros,
would withstand a discount rate of more than 45%, and an annual drop in cash flows of more than 80%
compared to the projected cash flows.

Along with the goodwill arising from the full consolidation of Hochtief, A.G. mentioned above, the most
significant goodwill, which amounted to EUR 554,420 thousand (EUR 554,420 thousand at 31 December
2022), arose from the merger with the Dragados Group in 2003 and related to the amount paid in excess of
the value of the assets on the acquisition date. This goodwill was allocated mainly to the Construction cashgenerating unit of Dragados.

In 2023, the ACS Group assessed the recoverability of the goodwill allocated to Construction, comparing the
carrying amount of the company or cash-generating unit (CGU) against its value in use, determined using
the discounted cash flow method and internal projections for each of the companies.

The discount rate used is its weighted average cost of capital. To calculate the discount rate for Dragados, a
weighted discount rate by country is used taking into consideration Dragados’ sales in the main countries in
which it operates as of September 2023, i.e., the United States, Spain, Canada, Poland, the United
Kingdom, Peru and Chile. The following are used to calculate the discount rate for each of the countries: the
10-year bond yield; the unlevered beta of the sector according to Damodaran, relevered by the target debt;
and the market risk premium by country according to Damodaran. The cost of the gross debt is the
consolidated effective real cost of the debt at September 2023 and the tax rate used is the theoretical rate.
The perpetual growth rate (g) used is equal to the increase in the CPI weighted in the countries in which
Dragados operates for 2028 based on the IMF’s report of October 2023 (2.02%)

The key assumptions used in the valuation of the Dragados Construction cash-generating unit are as
follows:

– Five-year forecasts used based on internal estimates.

– Weighted perpetual growth rate of 2.02% (1.95% in 2022).

– Weighted discount rate of 9.79% (10.12% in 2022).

The main variables considered in this test did not differ significantly from those considered in the impairment
test of the previous year.

After testing the impairment of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill arising from the merger with
the Dragados Group in 2003 has been allocated, it has been determined, based on the above assumptions,
that under no circumstances is the estimated recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit less than its
carrying amount, as there is no evidence of its impairment.

No reasonable scenario gave rise for the need to recognise an impairment loss. The impairment tests for the
Construction cash-generating unit showed that it would withstand substantial increases in the discount rates
of over 734 basis points and significant negative deviations (over 1.7%) in the budgeted EBITDA without
incurring an impairment loss.

Accordingly, the directors consider that the sensitivity ranges of the tests as regards the key assumptions
are within a reasonable range and, therefore, no impairment was detected in 2023 or 2022.

In relation to the remaining goodwill, excluding that generated by the merger between ACS and the
Dragados Group and the goodwill arising from the full consolidation of Hochtief, A.G., in the case of the
Services area, the total amount comes to EUR 173,000 thousand (EUR 169,865 thousand at 31 December
2022), corresponding to 24 different companies, the largest of which relates to the purchase of 25% of Clece
for EUR 115,902 thousand (EUR 115,902 thousand at 31 December 2022), with no indications of
impairment having been identified.

In the Construction area, the goodwill most notably includes that related to the acquisitions of Pulice, John P.
Picone and Schiavone amounting to EUR 172,058 thousand (EUR 178,251 thousand at 31 December
2022), and that from acquisitions by the Hochtief Group after the takeover.

In these areas, the impairment tests to calculate the goodwill are based on assumptions similar to those
described for each area of activity or in the case of the Dragados Group goodwill, taking into account the
necessary adjustments based on the peculiarities, geographical markets and specific circumstances of the
companies concerned.

According to the estimates and projections available to the directors of the Group and of each of the
companies concerned, the projected cash flows attributable to these cash-generating units (or groups of
units) to which the goodwill is allocated will make it possible to recover the carrying amount of each item of
goodwill recognised at 31 December 2023.

As indicated in IAS 36, as of 31 December 2023 the Group has not found any evidence of significant
impairment on goodwill and other assets subject to impairment testing. There have been no significant
changes in the assumptions used when testing the Group’s goodwill for impairment that could give rise to a
significant risk of recognising an impairment loss in the future.

No impairment losses were recognised in 2023 or 2022 on the ACS Group’s goodwill.

The additions in 2023 amounted to EUR 25,605 thousand (EUR 13,752 thousand in 2022) relating mainly to
Hochtief in the amount of EUR 20,623 thousand (EUR 11,653 thousand in 2022).

In 2023 impairment losses amounting to EUR 66 thousand were recognised under “Other intangible
assets” (EUR 572 thousand in 2022). No impairment losses were reversed or recognised in the
consolidated income statement in 2023. In 2022, a total of EUR 302 thousand in impairment losses were
reversed in the consolidated income statements.

The main assets recognised under “Other intangible assets” correspond to those generated in the first
Hochtief consolidation process as a result of allocating the price to the fair value of the assets acquired and
the liabilities assumed under the PPA (“Purchase Price Allocation”). This process most notably includes
Hochtief’s construction backlog (mainly due to contracts in the Americas and Asia Pacific), prior to
amortisation and impairment, amounting to EUR 603,655 thousand (EUR 603,655 thousand at 31
December 2022), which is fully amortised; the various trademarks of the Hochtief Group amounting to EUR
221,096 thousand (EUR 221,096 thousand at 31 December 2022); and the contractual relationships with
customers of the Hochtief Group amounting to EUR 598,189 thousand (EUR 598,189 thousand at 31
December 2022). The accumulated amortisation on the above assets amounted to EUR 1,119,492 thousand
(EUR 1,078,499 thousand at 31 December 2022). The amortisation charge for the year amounted to EUR
40,994 thousand (EUR 40,994 thousand at 31 December 2022).

In 2023 and 2022, no development expenditure was recognised as an expense in the consolidated income
statement for 2023 and 2022, respectively.

At 31 December 2023, the amount of assets with an indefinite useful life other than those reported as
“Goodwill” relate mainly to the trademarks of the Hochtief Americas and Hochtief Asia Pacific divisions
amounting to EUR 44,416 thousand (EUR 46,027 thousand at 31 December 2022). Indications of possible
impairment is verified annually. There were no significant impairment losses on these assets in 2023 or
2022.

At the end of 2023, the ACS Group had fully amortised intangible assets still in use with a gross carrying
amount of EUR 627,876 thousand (EUR 628,880 thousand at 31 December 2022).

There were no material intangible asset items whose title was restricted in 2023 or 2022.

(EUR 251,509 thousand in 2022), and most notably includes the investments made by Hochtief amounting
to EUR 142,385 thousand (EUR 219,947 thousand in 2022).

The depreciation and amortisation relating to the right to use the assets recognised in accordance with IFRS

recognised arising from the lease obligation amounted to EUR 29,497 thousand in 2023 (EUR 23,926
thousand in 2022) included in the consolidated income statement.

“Non-current lease liabilities” and “Current lease liabilities” associated with these “Right-of-use assets” at 31
December 2023 amounted to EUR 543,162 and EUR 160,569 thousand, respectively (EUR 550,746 and

Variable lease payments were not material at 31 December 2023 or 2022.

Sublease income is not significant since the ACS Group companies operate on a lessee rather than a lessor
basis.

There are assets leased under short-term leases or leases of low-value assets that do not apply IFRS 16
“Leases” since throughout the Group there are very short-term leases, generally for three to six months, or
ongoing monthly agreements or contracts with termination clauses. For each lease, the Group analyses and
assesses whether it is reasonably certain that the lease will be extended. These considerations include
assessing the requirements of the asset in the project, the scope of the work that is to be carried out with
this asset, and other relevant economic aspects to adequately assess the lease term. At 31 December
2023, the expenses accrued in the amount of EUR 513,284 thousand (EUR 442,781 thousand at 31
December 2022) on the above assets were recognised under “Other operating expenses” in the
consolidated income statement.

The Group has taken out insurance policies to cover the possible risks to which its property, plant and
equipment are subject and the claims that might be filed against it for carrying on its business activities.
These policies are considered to adequately cover the related risks.

At 31 December 2023 and 2022, no significant items of property, plant and equipment were subject to
restrictions.

The ACS Group has mortgaged land and buildings with a carrying amount of approximately EUR 28,867
thousand (EUR 36,635 thousand in 2022) to secure banking facilities granted to the Group.

At 31 December 2023, the Group had recognised EUR 1,122,984 thousand, net of depreciation, relating to
property, plant and equipment owned by foreign companies and branches of the Group (EUR 1,197,791
thousand at 31 December 2022).

**06. Non-current assets in projects**

The balance of “Non-current assets in projects” in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31
December 2023 includes the costs incurred by the fully consolidated companies in the construction of
transport infrastructure, services and power plants, the operation of which constitutes the purpose of their
respective concessions. These amounts relate to property, plant and equipment associated with projects
financed under a project finance arrangement and concessions identified as intangible assets or those that
are included as a financial asset according to the criteria discussed in Note 03.04. To better understand its
activities relating to infrastructure projects, the Group considers it more appropriate to group its
infrastructure projects together for presentation purposes, although they are broken down by type of asset
(financial or intangible) in this Note.

In 2023, there were no significant changes under this heading.

The most significant changes in this heading in 2022 were the solar thermal power plants associated with
the Tonopah renewable energy plants in the United States and Manchasol 1 Central Termosolar Uno, S.L.
(see Note 03.09.01).

– Construction

At 31 December 2023, the Construction area most notably included the investments from the Hochtief
Group accounted for using the equity method in the amount of EUR 1,426,987 thousand (EUR 1,545,232
thousand at 31 December 2022). In this last case, it should be noted that Thiess is accounted for as a joint
venture using the equity method for EUR 806 million (EUR 812 million at 31 December 2022).

In addition, the changes in investments accounted for using the equity method in 2022 most notably
included Ventia’s interest in Cimic, which after 31 March 2022 was recognised as a non-current financial
asset instead of being accounted for using the equity method (see Notes 02.02.f and 10.01).

The carrying amount of investments accounted for using the equity method in the Construction Division has
decreased due to both translation differences and distributed dividends, mainly relating to Hochtief.

– Concessions

At 31 December 2023, the Concessions area most notably included the ownership interest in Abertis
amounting to EUR 3,523,574 thousand (EUR 2,971,045 thousand at 31 December 2022), relating to the
ACS Group’s 50% interest (through both Hochtief and ACS Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A.).
The net contribution by Abertis to the ACS Group’s consolidated profit in 2023 amounted to a profit of EUR
179,229 thousand (a profit of EUR 142,964 thousand in 2022) once amortisation of the existing purchase
price allocation had been taken into account.

In addition, the remaining 21.62% of the SH288 highway was recognised at 31 December 2023 (see Note
02.02.f).

**_09.02._** **_Material associates / Joint arrangements_**

**Material associates and joint ventures**

In accordance with IFRS 12, the associates and joint ventures that are considered to be material at 31
December 2023 and 2022 are Abertis Holdco, S.A. and its Subsidiaries and Thiess Joint Venture,
respectively.

Abertis

On 27 July 2023, the ACS Group and Mundys (formerly Atlantia) reached a new strategic collaboration
agreement for Abertis with the main objective of strengthening its global leadership in transport
infrastructure concessions, agreeing to promote an investment plan that will enable it to expand the portfolio
of assets under management. The agreement also includes a new governance scheme that does not
change Abertis’s method of accounting.

At 31 December 2023, the ACS Group held a 50% interest in Abertis Holdco, S.A, giving the ACS Group
significant influence in Abertis Holdco, S.A. within the meaning of IAS 28. Therefore, Abertis is accounted for
as an associate using the equity method in these Consolidated Annual Accounts.

In 2023, the ACS Group received dividends from Abertis Holdco, S.A. amounting to EUR 296,845 thousand
(EUR 296,845 thousand in 2022). At 31 December 2023, the irrevocable commitment relating to the capital
increase of EUR 650 million (50% of the total EUR 1,300 million commitment) approved by Abertis Holdco’s
shareholders prior to the reporting date was recognised and it was paid on 15 February 2024.

In 2023, to assess whether or not there were any indications of impairment of its interest in Abertis, the
Group estimated the fair value of this shareholding. Therefore, the fair value of Abertis at year-end 2023 was
restated in accordance with the Group’s policies. The recoverable amount of the interest in Abertis
accounted for using the equity method was compared with its carrying amount, and no impairment was
detected. The ACS Group compared the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU), which includes
the goodwill, with the fair value obtained using the discounted cash flow method (Abertis Holdco, S.A. and
Subsidiaries). In accordance with IAS 36, the ACS Group considered that the most appropriate methodology
for calculating the fair value corresponds to the assessment of a projected finite period of 5 years
(2024-2028) together with the estimate of a residual value.

Based on the budgets and latest long-term projections, the impairment test on the Abertis goodwill as at 31
December 2023 was prepared based on:

– The cash projections obtained from the income and expense projection for the entire Abertis Group
for the period (2024-2028) carried out by Abertis.

– To determine the terminal value, a growth rate of 2.0% was applied to the operating free cash flow
after taxes for the last projected year, i.e. 2028, and, additionally, a cash outflow for investments in
perpetuity was considered equivalent to the amortisation over this period.

The discount rate (WACC) applied to the cash flow projections was 5.95% and, in the case of the terminal
value, the WACC applied was increased by 2.0%.

In relation to the result of the impairment test on the interest in Abertis accounted for using the equity
method, the recoverable amount obtained (determined based on the fair value as indicated above) exceeds
the carrying amount of the goodwill and the assets, so that the carrying amount of the investment in Abertis
recognised at 31 December 2023 by the ACS Group can be recovered.

Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, the impairment test shows certain leeway as regards the
carrying amount and is sensitive to changes in the discount rate and cash flows in perpetuity. Therefore, a
drop in net operating profit after tax of more than 10 % and an increase in the WACC by more than 50 basis
points could result in the need to recognise an impairment loss on the consolidated carrying amount of
Abertis.

As in the previous year, investments in associates are not subject to any restrictions.

Thiess

On 31 December 2020, the Group finalised an agreement with funds managed by Elliott for the acquisition
by Elliott of a 50% interest in the share capital of Thiess. According to the terms of the sale agreement, the
ACS Group no longer controls Thiess, which is jointly controlled by Cimic and Elliott.

(*) The Thiess shareholder agreement establishes a minimum distribution to each shareholder of AUD 180.0 million (EUR 110.1 million)
per year during the first six years. In addition, Thiess issued Class C preference shares (see Note 11) providing a coupon yield above
all other equity instruments in the amount of EUR 14.0 million (EUR 3.2 million in 2022) for the Group’s shareholding. Accordingly, the
returns are attributable first to both the Class C preference shares held by the Group and by Elliott and then to Elliott’s minimum
distribution. The Group’s share of the profit for the period thus amounted to EUR 53.5 million (EUR 57.9 million in 2022). The amounts
of insufficient returns for the Group include protection rights, which would be recovered through future profits.

In 2023, the ACS Group received dividends from Thiess amounting to EUR 29,974 thousand (EUR 59,083
thousand in 2022).

Cimic and Elliott financed the acquisition of MACA Limited (Australia) in 2022 through Thiess by subscribing
new Thiess Class C preference shares. Cimic invested AUD 191.3 million (EUR 126.2 million). The
preference shares were issued to the two investors in equal proportions and under the same conditions, and
offer a coupon yield above all other equity instruments. These Class C preference shares are considered to
be a non-current investment in Thiess not accounted for using the equity method in accordance with IAS 28;
therefore, the equity instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9.4.1.4
is recognised under “Non-current financial assets - Non-current equity instruments” (see Note 10.01). The
coupon, in the form of a dividend, is recognised as cash flows from operating activities.

and EUR 163,639 thousand at 31 December 2022). The decrease in the amount of non-current equity
instruments with respect to 31 December 2022 is due to the reclassification in 2023 of Ventia’s interest in
Cimic as a non-current asset held for sale (see Note 02.02.f) and the subsequent sale of the entire interest
this year. In addition, the Thiess Class C preference shares of EUR 131.7 million (AUD 214.2 million) at 31

“Others” basically includes changes related to production and/or invoicing to customers during the year and
the payments obtained from them, and the reclassifications from completed work pending certification to
trade receivables and notes receivable.

Should the amount of output from inception, measured at the amount to be billed, of each project be greater
than the amount billed up to the date of the statement of financial position, the difference between the two
amounts relates to contractual assets and is recognised under “Completed work pending certification” under
“Trade and other receivables” on the asset side of the consolidated statement of financial position.

Should the amount of output from inception be lower than the amount of the progress billings, the difference
relates to contractual liabilities and is recognised under “Customer advances” under “Trade and other


-----

76

payables” on the liability side of the consolidated statement of financial position. Therefore, the balances are
presented based on each project/work at both 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022.

“Total contract liabilities” includes both “Customer advances” and “Pre-certified construction work
customers”.

Incremental costs are not significant in relation to the total contract assets with customers.

The revenue recognised in 2023 that was included in the balance of “Customer advances” (contract
liabilities with customers) at the beginning of the year amounts to EUR 1,753 million (EUR 1,783 million in
2022), while the revenue recognised in 2023 resulting from performance obligations that were satisfied or
partially satisfied in previous years amounts to a loss of EUR (75) million.

At 31 December 2023, retentions held by customers for contract work in progress amounted to EUR
1,513,956 thousand (EUR 1,337,461 thousand at 31 December 2022).

The Group companies assign trade receivables to financial institutions, without the possibility of recourse
against them in the event of non-payment. The reduced balance of receivables amounted to EUR 1,106,441
thousand at 31 December 2023 (EUR 1,063,190 thousand at 31 December 2022).

Substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the receivables, and control over them, were
transferred through the sale and assignment of the receivables, since there are no repurchase agreements
between the Group companies and the banks that have acquired the assets, and the banks may freely
dispose of the acquired assets without the Group companies being able to limit this right in any manner.
Consequently, the balances receivable relating to the receivables assigned or sold under the above
conditions were derecognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group companies
continued to manage collection during the year.

There was no customer as at 31 December 2023 and 2022, that represented more than 10% of total
revenue.

**_12.02._** **_Changes in the allowances for doubtful debts_**

A concentration of credit risk is not considered to exist since the Group has a large number of customers
engaging in various activities.

The net trade receivables balance at 31 December 2023 amounted to EUR 4,790,650 thousand (EUR
4,456,616 thousand at 31 December 2022), of which EUR 558,146 thousand (EUR 465,198 thousand at 31
December 2022) relate to domestic activity and EUR 4,232,504 thousand (EUR 3,991,418 thousand at 31
December 2022) to international activity.


-----

77

As regards domestic activity, EUR 393,133 thousand (EUR 315,997 thousand at 31 December 2022), 70%
of the balance (68% of the balance at 31 December 2022), relates to the net balance receivable from the
Spanish public authorities, while the remainder relates to the private sector, without a large concentration of
balances.

Group management considers that the carrying amount of the trade receivables reflects their fair value. The
Group companies are responsible for managing the accounts receivable and determining whether
provisions need to be recognised, since each company best knows its exact position and the relationship
with each of its customers. However, each business area establishes certain guidelines on the basis that
each customer has their own peculiarities depending on the business activity performed. The accounts
receivable from public authorities do not pose any significant problems regarding recoverability, and
international activity mainly relates to work performed for public authorities in foreign countries, which
reduces the possibility of experiencing significant insolvency.

Furthermore, a policy has been established for private customers where guarantees are provided before
beginning construction work, which significantly reduces the risk of insolvency. Lastly, the existence of
arrears and possible default are low since, besides the fact that the Group also has the right to request late
payment interest from public authorities, its private customers are assigned a maximum risk level before
contracting a service.

As regards foreign activities, the majority arises from the private sector amounting to EUR 3,833,417
thousand (EUR 3,243,749 thousand at 31 December 2022), the majority of which relate to the Hochtief
Group. The status of customers that are past due but not impaired as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is
detailed under “Credit risk” in Note 21.

**13. Other current assets**

This heading in the statement of financial position includes mainly short-term accruals of prepaid expenses
and interest.

**14. Cash and cash equivalents**

“Cash and cash equivalents” includes the Group’s cash and short-term bank deposits with an initial maturity
of three months or less, and other short-term, highly liquid investments (maturing within less than three
months) that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of
changes in value.

The carrying amount of these assets amounting to EUR 390,824 thousand at 31 December 2023 (EUR
484,221 thousand at 31 December 2022) reflects their fair value and there are no restrictions as to their use.

**15. Equity**

**_15.01._** **_Share capital_**

As at 31 December 2023, the share capital of the Parent Company amounted to EUR 139,082 thousand
(EUR 142,082 thousand at 31 December 2022) and was represented by 278,164,594 fully subscribed and
paid shares (284,164,594 shares at 31 December 2022) with a par value of EUR 0.5 each, all with the same
voting and dividend rights.

On 23 March 2023, in accordance with the resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting held on 6 May
2022, the Board of Directors of ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. agreed to reduce share
capital, with a charge to profit or unrestricted reserves, through the retirement of 6 million of the Company’s


-----

78

treasury shares for a nominal amount of EUR 3 million, recognising a provision for the same amount with a
charge to reserves as indicated in section 335.c) of the Corporate Enterprises Act (see Note 15.04).

In 2022, the Board of Directors of the Parent retired, on several occasions, a total of 20,500,000 shares in
accordance with the resolutions passed by the shareholders at the General Meeting, reducing the share
capital by a nominal amount of EUR 10,250,000 through the retirement of 20.5 million ACS treasury shares
with a charge to profit or unrestricted reserves, recognising the corresponding provision with a charge to
reserves as indicated in section 335.c) of the Corporate Enterprises Act (see Note 15.04).

Expenses directly attributable to the issue or acquisition of new shares are recognised in equity as a
deduction from the amount of equity.

At the Annual General Meeting held on 8 May 2020, the shareholders agreed to delegate to the Board of
Directors, in accordance with section 297.1(b) of the consolidated text of the Corporate Enterprises Act, the
power to increase, on one or more occasions, the Company’s share capital up to a maximum of 50% of the
share capital, as of the date of the Meeting, within a maximum period of five years from the date of this
General Meeting.

The share capital increase(s) may be carried out, with or without a share premium, either by increasing the
par value of the existing shares in accordance with that established by law, or by issuing new shares,
ordinary or preferential, with or without voting rights, or redeemable shares, or any other type of shares
permitted by law or several types at the same time, consisting of a consideration for the new shares or an
increase in the par value of the existing ones, in terms of monetary contributions.

It was also agreed to authorise the Board of Directors so that, in all matters not provided for, it can set the
terms of the share capital increases and the characteristics of the shares, and freely offer the new
unsubscribed shares within the term(s) for exercising the pre-emption right. The Board may also establish
that, if the issue is undersubscribed, the share capital will only be increased by the amount of the shares
subscribed, and revise the wording of the corresponding article of the Articles of Association regarding the
share capital and number of shares.

The Board is expressly granted the power to exclude, in full or in part, the pre-emption right up to a
maximum nominal amount, collectively, equal to 20% of the share capital at the time of authorisation in
relation to all or any of the issues agreed based on this authorisation, in line with section 506 of the
Corporate Enterprises Act, which also includes the exclusions of the pre-emption rights carried out in the
framework of securities issues in accordance with the resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting of
10 May 2019.

At the Annual General Meeting of ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. held on 5 May 2023,
the shareholders resolved, among other matters, to carry out a share capital increase and reduction. The
Company resolved to increase share capital to a maximum of EUR 580 million with a charge to unrestricted
reserves, whereby the first capital increase may not exceed EUR 450 million and the second increase may
not exceed EUR 130 million, indistinctly granting the Executive Committee, the Chairman of the Board and
the Director Secretary the power to execute the resolution. The capital increase is expected to take place, in
the case of the first increase, within the three months following the date of the Annual General Meeting held
in 2023 and, in the case of the second increase, within the first quarter of 2024, thereby coinciding with the
dates on which the ACS Group has traditionally distributed the final dividend and the interim dividend. As
regards the capital reduction, the resolution passed by the Board consists of reducing share capital through
the retirement of the Company’s treasury shares for a nominal amount equal to the nominal amount for
which the above capital increase was effectively carried out. The Board is granted the power to execute
these resolutions, on one or two occasions, simultaneously with each of the share capital increases (see
Note 15.04).

Note 15.04).

The shares representing the capital of ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. are admitted for
trading on the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia Stock Exchanges and are listed on the continuous
market.

In addition to the Parent Company, the company included in the scope of consolidation whose shares are

share capital was Rosan Inversiones, S.L. with an interest of 14.16%.

**_15.02._** **_Share premium_**

The share premium at 31 December 2023 and 2022 amounted to EUR 366,379 thousand and EUR 366,379
thousand, respectively.

The consolidated text of the Corporate Enterprises Act expressly permits the use of the share premium
account balance to increase capital and does not establish any specific restrictions as to its use. This
reserve is unrestricted provided that the Company’s equity does not fall below share capital as a result of its
distribution.

**_15.03._** **_Reserves_**

The detail of this heading at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is as follows:

Reserves at consolidated companies (3,522,780) (3,140,766)

**Total** **4,188,688** **4,625,358**


This heading includes the reserves set up by the Group’s Parent Company, mainly in relation to retained
earnings and, where applicable, in compliance with the various applicable legal provisions.

**Legal reserve**

Under the consolidated text of the Corporate Enterprises Act, 10% of net profit for each year must be
transferred to the legal reserve until the balance of this reserve reaches at least 20% of the share capital.


-----

80

The legal reserve can be used to increase capital provided that the remaining reserve balance does not fall
below 10% of the increased share capital amount. Otherwise, until the legal reserve exceeds 20% of share
capital, it can only be used to offset losses, provided that sufficient other reserves are not available for this
purpose.

The legal reserve of the Group’s Parent Company, which amounts to EUR 35,287 thousand, exceed the
stipulated level at 31 December 2023 and 2022.

**Voluntary reserves**

These are reserves, the use of which is not limited or restricted in any way, freely set up by means of the
allocation of the Parent Company’s profits, after the payment of dividends and the required appropriations to
the legal or other restricted reserves in accordance with current law.

Pursuant to the consolidated text of the Corporate Enterprises Act, profit may not be distributed unless the
amount of the unrestricted legal reserves is at least equal to the amount of research and development
expenses included under assets in the statement of financial position. In this case, the reserves allocated to
meet this requirement are considered to be restricted reserves.

Certain Group companies have clauses in their financing agreements (this is standard practice in project
financing) that place restrictions on the distribution of dividends until certain ratios are met.

**Capital redemption reserve**

As a result of the redemption of the Parent Company’s shares carried out in 2023 and 2022, in accordance
with section 335.c) of the consolidated text of the Corporate Enterprises Act, ACS, Actividades de
Construcción y Servicios, S.A. established a restricted “Capital redemption reserve” of EUR 72,216
thousand (EUR 64,367 thousand at 31 December 2022), which is equivalent to the nominal value of the
reduced share capital.

Reserve for actuarial gains and losses

This item includes the effects on pension plans due to actuarial impacts such as changes in the technical
interest rate, mortality tables, etc.

to interest rate hedges and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange rate hedges, tied to asset and liability items
in the consolidated statement of financial position, and to future transaction commitments qualifying for
hedge accounting mainly from the interest in Abertis.

The changes relating to financial assets through other comprehensive income include the unrealised gains
or losses arising from changes in their fair value net of the related tax effect.

The translation differences at 1 January 2004 were recognised in the transition to IFRSs as opening
reserves. Consequently, the amount presented in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position at
31 December 2023 relates exclusively to the difference arising in the period from 2004 to 2023, net of the
related tax effect, between the closing and opening exchange rates, on non-monetary items whose fair
value is adjusted against equity and on the translation to euros of the balances in the functional currencies
of fully and proportionally consolidated companies, and companies accounted for using the equity method,
whose functional currency is not the euro.

The main translation differences, by currency, at 31 December 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

At 31 December 2023, “Non-controlling interests” mainly related to the consolidation of Hochtief, which
includes both the ownership interests of the minority shareholders of Hochtief and the non-controlling
interests included in the statement of financial position of the German company, amounting to EUR 30,787
thousand at 31 December 2023 (EUR 95,674 thousand at 31 December 2022).

In 2023, a 7.29% interest in Hochtief, A.G. was acquired, amounting to EUR 461.3 million, at an average
price of EUR 81.47 per share, which increased the interest in Hochtief, A.G. at the end of 2023 to 75.93% of
the shares representing the share capital without discounting treasury shares, and to 78.48% when treasury
shares are discounted.

On 8 June 2022, Hochtief, A.G. decided to increase its share capital by just under 10% through a monetary
contribution using authorised capital, issuing 7,064,593 new shares at EUR 57.50 per share, excluding
shareholders’ subscription rights. ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. was assigned 85% of
the total number of new shares, which represents an increase in its shareholding in Hochtief, A.G. from
50.41% to 53.55% of the shares representing the share capital. The cash obtained in the capital increase
was used to repay part of the financing obtained for the acquisition of Cimic (see Note 03.23).

In addition, in 2022 additional shares in Hochtief, A.G. were acquired for an amount of EUR 604 million,
increasing the shareholding in this company at the end of 2022 to 68.64% of the shares representing the
share capital, without discounting treasury shares, and to 70.94%, when treasury shares are discounted.

On 23 February 2022, Hochtief, Cimic’s majority shareholder with a 78.6% interest, announced a tender
offer to acquire the remaining shares of Cimic for AUD 22 per share, which gave Hochtief a 100% interest

In relation to bank loans, the most relevant matters during the period are as follows:

– ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. has a syndicated loan in the amount of EUR
2,100,000 thousand divided into two tranches (tranche A of the loan, drawn down in full, in the
amount of EUR 950,000 thousand, and tranche B, a liquidity facility, in the amount of EUR
1,150,000 thousand), which matures on 13 October 2026 (except for EUR 10 million maturing in
2025). No amount has been drawn down on the liquidity facility of tranche B as at 31 December
2023 and 2022. There have been no changes as regards the other terms.

– On 29 June 2017, the Company (Dragados, S.A.) and its investee (Dragados Construction USA,
Inc.), as “Borrowers”, signed a syndicated loan agreement with a group of international financial
institutions, amounting to USD 270,000 thousand (EUR 248,482 thousand), which was drawn down
in full by Dragados Construction USA, Inc. On 22 June 2021, an agreement was reached to roll over
the above loan agreement, whereby the amount of the loan was simultaneously repaid in part and
increased, resulting in a tranche A of USD 232,750 thousand (EUR 214,200 thousand) and a
tranche B of USD 62,250 thousand (EUR 57,289 thousand). Dragados Construction USA, Inc. used
USD 37,250 thousand (EUR 34,281 thousand) of tranche B to partially repay the initial amount.
Both tranches had been drawn down in full at 31 December 2023. The total amount of the loan was
USD 295,000 thousand (EUR 266,968 thousand). In addition, the maturity date was extended to 28
June 2026, the date on which it will be fully repaid, with the rest of the terms unchanged. The
principal of this loan accrues interest at a rate tied to the USD SOFR.

– On 20 December 2018, Dragados, S.A. entered into a syndicated transaction amounting to a total of
EUR 323,800 thousand, which was divided into tranche A as a loan amounting to EUR 161,900
thousand and tranche B as a credit facility for the same amount as tranche A. Subsequently, on 19
December 2019, this agreement was renewed, and tranches A and B were increased by EUR
70,000 thousand each, for a total of EUR 463,800 thousand. On 15 December 2022, an agreement
was reached to roll over the financing agreement, extending its maturity date by one year to 20
December 2024. Finally, the agreement was rolled over on 30 November 2023, extending the final
maturity date to 19 June 2026 and increasing the financing granted to EUR 465,000 thousand (EUR
232,500 thousand for tranche A and EUR 232,500 thousand for tranche B). After a new entity was
included in the agreement in January 2024, the amount rose to EUR 470,000 thousand (EUR
235,000 thousand for each tranche). As at 31 December 2023, only EUR 232,500 thousand of
tranche A had been drawn down. The principal of the loan and the credit facility will accrue interest
tied to the Euribor.

– Hochtief refinanced, before maturity, the existing long-term syndicated loan of EUR 1,700 million
maturing in 2024 and obtained another EUR 300 million for future corporate purposes, including the
refinancing of existing credit facilities. Hochtief and an international bank syndicate reached an
agreement for a credit facility with a five-year term from 30 March 2023 and options for an extension
of up to two additional years. The total amount is divided into EUR 1,200 million in guarantee lines,
EUR 500 million in credit facilities and EUR 300 million in loans.

– Cimic replaced the syndicated credit facility of AUD 1,000 million (EUR 612 million), maturing in July
2025, and repaid it in early October using two loan tranches of AUD 693 million (EUR 424 million)
and USD 239 million (EUR 231 million), both maturing in five years.

– In early October 2023, Cimic also repaid its credit facility of AUD 950 million (EUR 581 million)
ahead of schedule. In the process, Cimic entered into a new credit facility for AUD 625 million (EUR
383 million) with a three-year term and a credit facility for AUD 522 million (EUR 319 million) with a
five-year term. Cimic was therefore able to increase its liquidity reserves on the whole by more than
AUD 267 million (EUR 164 million).

– In November 2023, Cimic signed a three-year syndicated bonding facility for AUD 1,300 million
(EUR 799 million). This facility replaces the credit facility of AUD 1,400 million (EUR 861 million) that
matured in March 2024 and covers the Cimic Group’s operational guarantee requirements in
addition to the existing bilateral guarantee and bonding facilities.

The undrawn balances of the credit facilities granted to Group companies at 31 December 2023, by
maturity, are as follows:

At 31 December 2023, current and non-current bank borrowings in foreign currencies amounted to EUR
2,194,165 thousand (EUR 2,634,071 thousand at 31 December 2022), of which mainly EUR 1,256,261
thousand are in Australian dollars (EUR 1,513,951 thousand at 31 December 2022), EUR 685,734 thousand
are in US dollars (EUR 882,100 thousand at 31 December 2022) and EUR 206,625 thousand are in
Canadian dollars (EUR 143,922 thousand at 31 December 2022).

Foreign currency loans and credits are recognised at their equivalent euro value at each year-end,
calculated at the exchange rates prevailing at 31 December (see Note 03.21).

In 2023 the Group’s euro loans and credits bore average annual interest of 2.77% (1.91% in 2022). Foreign
currency loans and credits bore average annual interest of 5.99% (4.28% in 2022).

In accordance with its risk management policy, the ACS Group attempts to achieve a reasonable balance
between non-current financing for the Group’s strategic investments (above all, limited recourse project
financing, as described in Note 18) and current financing for the management of working capital. The effect
of the changes in interest rates on finance costs are indicated in Note 21.

In 2023 and 2022, the ACS Group satisfactorily met its bank borrowing payment obligations on maturity. In
addition, up to the date of the preparation of the Consolidated Annual Accounts, there was no significant
non-compliance with its financial obligations. Accordingly, at 31 December 2023, the ACS Group met the
significant ratios required by its financing agreements.

The Group has arranged various interest rate hedges in connection with the above financing (see Note 22).

The average interest rate for this type of project financing amounted to an annual 4.68% in 2023 and 3.21%
in 2022.

The debts relating to limited recourse financing are secured by project assets and include clauses requiring
that certain ratios be achieved by the project, which were being met in all cases at the date of authorisation
for issue of these Annual Accounts. Except as specifically mentioned in the previous paragraphs in relation
to each of the most relevant financing, there were no guarantees in the form of collateral at 31 December
2023 and 2022.

In 2023 and 2022 the ACS Group satisfactorily settled all its project financing debts with limited recourse on
maturity. In addition, up to the date of the preparation of these Consolidated Annual Accounts, there was no
significant non-compliance with its financial obligations.

The amount corresponding to “Other financial liabilities” in the consolidated statement of financial position
mainly includes the financing obtained from public bodies in various countries to carry out certain
infrastructure projects, which most notably includes the participating loan from the Spanish State granted to
Autovía Medinaceli-Calatayud Sociedad Concesionaria del Estado, S.A., with an outstanding amount at 31
December 2023 of EUR 52,498 thousand (EUR 52,498 thousand at 31 December 2022) to finance the
rebalancing achieved in 2011, and that matures during the remaining term of the concession (2026).

“Non-bank borrowings at a reduced interest rate” are loans at reduced or zero interest rates granted by the
Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competition and dependent agencies. The effect of the financing at
market interest rates would not be material.

The Group companies recognise provisions on the liability side of the accompanying consolidated statement
of financial position for present obligations arising from past events which the companies consider will
probably require an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits to settle them on maturity. These
provisions are recognised when the related obligation arises and the amount recognised is the best estimate
at the date of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the present value of the future
expenditure required to settle the obligation. The change in the year relating to the discount to present value
is recognised as interest cost in the consolidated income statement. The reduction between years is mainly
due to the reassessment carried out to cover operating risks, litigation and claims both in Spain and abroad,
including guarantees for possible claims related to assets sold.

Following is detailed information on the Group’s provisions, distributed into three large groups:

20.01.01 Provisions for pensions and similar obligations

On the one hand, defined benefit pension obligations were entered into by companies included in the group
as a result of the merger by absorption of the Dragados Group in 2003. These obligations were externalised
through group life insurance policies, in which investments have been assigned whose flows coincide in
timing and amount with the payment schedule of the insured benefits. Based on the valuation made, at 31
December 2023 the amounts required to cover the obligations to current and retired employees amounted
to EUR 3,985 thousand (EUR 4,002 thousand in 2022) and EUR 116,936 thousand (EUR 124,451 thousand
in 2022), respectively. The actuarial assumptions used in the 2023 and 2022 valuations detailed above, are
as follows:

|Actuarial assunptions|2023|2022|
|---|---|---|
|Annual rate of increase of maximum social security pension deficit Annual wage increase Annual CPI growth rate Mortality table ( * )|2.00 % 2.35 % 2.00 % PER2020_Col_1er.orden|8.50 % 2.35 % 8.50 % PER2020_Col_1er.orden|


**Actuarial assunptions** **2023** **2022**

Annual rate of increase of maximum social security pension deficit 2.00 % 8.50 %

Annual wage increase 2.35 % 2.35 %

Annual CPI growth rate 2.00 % 8.50 %

Mortality table ( * ) PER2020_Col_1er.orden PER2020_Col_1er.orden

( * ) Guaranteed assumptions which will not vary


The interest rates applied since the pension obligations were externalised ranged from a maximum of 5.93%
to a minimum 0.01%. The interest rate applied in 2023 was 2.43% (2.04% in 2022).

The amounts relating to the above pension obligations, recognised under “Personnel expenses” in the
consolidated income statement for 2023, gave rise to income of EUR 417 thousand in 2023 (expense of
EUR 179 thousand in 2022), relating mainly to the regularisation and redemption of the pension obligation,
for unpaid income accrued, of a certain group of employees from the Dragados Group.

Additionally, ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. and other Group companies have
alternative pension system obligations to certain members of the management team and Board of Directors
of the Parent Company. These obligations have been formalised through several group savings insurance
policies that provide benefits in the form of a lump sum, which represented a contribution of EUR 5,140
thousand in 2023 and was recognised under “Personnel expenses” in the consolidated statement of
financial position for the year. In 2022, the contribution in this connection amounted to EUR 4,009 thousand.

Except as indicated above, in general, the Spanish Group companies have not established any pension
plans to supplement the social security pension benefits. However, pursuant to the consolidated text of the
Spanish Pension Fund and Plan Act (Ley de Regulación de los Planes y Fondos de Pensiones), in the
specific cases in which similar obligations exist, the companies externalise their pension and other similar
obligations to employees. The Group has no liability in this connection.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations at the Hochtief Group

Some of the Group’s foreign companies have agreed to supplement the retirement benefit and other similar
obligations to its employees, including those from the Hochtief Group. The accrued obligations and, where
appropriate, the related plan assets were measured by independent actuarial experts using generally

accepted actuarial methods and techniques and the related amounts are recognised under “Non-current
provisions – Provisions for pensions and similar obligations” in the accompanying consolidated statement of
financial position, in accordance with IFRS.

Defined benefit plans

Under defined benefit plans, the Group’s obligation is to provide agreed benefits to current and former
employees. The main pension obligations in Germany consist of direct obligations under the current 2000+
pension plan and deferred compensation plans. The 2000+ plan, in force since 1 January 2000, takes the
form of a defined contribution plan. The size of the annual pension component depends on employee
income and age (resulting in an annuity conversion factor) and a general pension contribution reviewed by
Hochtief A.G. every three years and adjusted as necessary. The amount of the future pension is the total
sum of the pension components accrued each year. In isolated instances, length-of-service and final salary
pension arrangements are in place for executive staff, however, these arrangements have not been offered
since 1995, except for Executive Board members. Benefits comprise a retirement pension, an invalidity
pension and a surviving dependants’ pension and in almost all cases are granted as a life annuity.

Up until 31 December 2013, employees in Germany also had the option of deferred compensation in a
company pension plan. The deferred compensation was invested in selected investment funds. The pension
amount is based on the present value of the acquired fund units and the time of retirement, subject to a
minimum of the deferred compensation amount plus an annual increase guaranteed by Hochtief that ranges
from 3.50% to 1.75%. At retirement, there is a choice between a lump sum payment and an annuity for five
or six years.

Outside of Germany, there are defined benefit pension plans at Hochtief (UK) in the United Kingdom.
Hochtief (UK) has a length-of-service and final salary pension plan. For each year of service, 1/75th of the
eligible final salary is granted as a monthly pension. Benefits comprise a retirement pension, an invalidity
pension and a surviving dependants’ pension. The obligations at Turner include post-employment benefits in
the form of health insurance for retired employees.

The detail of the Hochtief Group’s defined benefit obligations as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is as
follows:

Plan assets

Germany

There are no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements for pension plans in Germany. Domestic
pension obligations are fully funded. The funded plans take the form of a contractual trust arrangement
(CTA). The transferred assets are managed by an external trustee and are solely used to fund the domestic
pension obligations of the fund. The transferred cash is invested in the capital market in accordance with
investment principles set out in the trust agreement and the investment guidelines. Investment decisions are
not taken by the trustee, but rather by an investment committee.

The investment guidelines and decisions are based on the findings of an asset liability matching (ALM)
study compiled by outside specialists at regular intervals of three to five years. This uses the Monte Carlo
simulation method to model the development of the pension liabilities and other key economic factors over a
very long forward horizon and in numerous combinations. Based on the ALM study, a range of criteria are
then applied to determine the optimum asset allocation to ensure that pension liabilities can be met in the
long term.

To achieve an optimal conservative risk structure, cross-sector risk management has also been adopted,
which uses the services of an independent external cross-sector manager with an annual fixed risk budget
in a clearly structured cross-sector risk management process. Hochtief aims to ensure the full funding of
pension obligations and to fund new vested benefits on the basis of current service cost on an annual or at
least timely basis. If at any time there is a shortfall, the companies would make an additional payment.
Pension obligations in Germany in excess of the contribution assessment ceiling applied in the legal
pension insurance scheme are also covered through pension liability insurance. Pension liabilities from
deferred employee compensation offered up until 31 December 2013 were funded through the purchase of
retail fund units. Funding of the obligations handled by Hochtief Pension Trust e.V. as at 31 December 2023
is around 53% (59% in 2022); the figure for Germany as a whole is around 61% (67% in 2022). The
reduction in funding ratios is mainly due to lower interest rates in the capital markets and the resulting
increase in the present value of pension liabilities.

United Kingdom

The plan assets of the Hochtief (UK) plan are also funded by means of a trust. Legal minimum funding
requirements apply. If funding is insufficient to make up a funding shortfall, an additional restructuring plan is
drawn up. Plan funding is reviewed at least once every three years. Funding of pension obligations at
Hochtief (UK) is around 81% (82% in 2022).

The discount factors are obtained from the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (MPDYC) model, taking
into account the company-specific duration of pension liabilities.

Biometric mortality assumptions are based on published country-specific statistics and experience. The
following mortality tables were used in the actuarial calculation of pension obligations:

In addition to the expenses recognised in the income statement, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income includes a reduction of EUR 35,749 thousand (EUR 197,747 thousand in 2022) in
adjustments to defined benefit plans in 2023 before deferred taxes and after changes in the scope of
consolidation and exchange rate. Before deferred taxes, cumulative actuarial losses amounted to EUR
343,606 thousand (EUR 307,857 thousand in 2022).

The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired employees are included in the pension
provisions due to their pension-like nature. At 31 December 2023, the defined benefit obligation came to
EUR 46,996 thousand (EUR 50,285 thousand in 2022). Healthcare costs represented EUR 1,359 thousand

Sensitivity analysis

Pension obligations in the Hochtief Group are subject to the following significant risks:

**Interest rate risk**

For defined contribution plans, (notional) contributions are translated into benefits using a table of fixed
interest rates, independent of the current market interest rate. Hochtief thus bears the risk of general capital
market interest rate changes as regards the determination of benefits. Pension obligations have increased
significantly in recent years due to the generally low level of interest rates in capital markets. This has a
significant impact due to the relatively long term of the obligations.

**Inflation risk**

By law, company pensions in Germany must be raised in line with the inflation rate at least every three
years. German company pensions under the 2000+ plan rise at an annual fixed rate of 1% and, therefore,
there is only minor inflation risk in the payment phase. Turner’s pension plans are not exposed to inflation
risk.

**Longevity risk**

Granting pensions in the form of life annuities means that Hochtief bears the risk of pensioners living longer
than predicted by actuarial calculations. This risk normally averages out across all pension plan participants
and only comes into play if general longevity is longer than expected.

The impact of the stated risks on the defined benefit obligations under a corresponding change in actuarial
assumptions is shown in the sensitivity analysis that follows.

**Contributions to defined benefit plans**

Contributions to defined benefit plans in 2024 are expected to amount to EUR 6,046 thousand.

Defined contribution plans

Under defined contribution plans, the Group pays into a state or private pension fund voluntarily or in
accordance with legal or contractual provisions. It has no obligation to pay further contributions.

There are different defined contribution pension plans at Turner, Flatiron and E.E. Cruz in the US, and at
Cimic in Australia. In the case of Turner, the employer matches the contribution at 2.5%, 3.75% or 5%,
depending on the years of service. In addition, Turner makes an earnings-based employer contribution of
between 3% and 9% of the employee’s salary. The participant’s 401k account is deposited in an external
trust managed by the registrar, Fidelity. Turner employees have the option to defer a portion of their base
salary up to the IRS annual limits in this plan. All eligible employees are automatically enrolled in the plan
immediately after being hired and are vested in the company’s contributions after three years of service. The
majority of payments made are tax exempt, but it is also possible to make contributions out of taxable
income and receive the investment returns tax free, with the investment risk being borne by the employees.
The defined contribution plans at Flatiron and E.E. Cruz are also 401k plans. All non-union US employees
are entitled to participate. A “safe harbour” contribution of 3.0% of employees’ eligible compensation is
made, regardless of the contribution they make. If employees contribute 3.0% or more out of their own
pocket, the company will contribute up to 3.0% to reach 100%. The company’s contribution is vested at an
annual 33% and is fully vested after three years of service. For office workers at Flatiron, 4.0% of their
eligible compensation is deducted as a contribution payment, regardless of their own participation in the
plan. Employer contributions are immediately vested. In Australia, Cimic has paid 11.00% (previously
10.50%) of the total wages and salary into the legal (retirement) pension plan since 1 July 2023. The
contribution rate is expected to gradually increase up to 12.0% by 2025. Employees have a choice of
investment funds and bear the investment risk. In addition, they can make supplementary contributions on a
voluntary basis, which are tax exempt.

The expenses are recognised as personnel expenses in the consolidated income statement.

20.01.02. Provisions for taxes

Non-current provisions include the amounts estimated by the Group to settle claims brought in connection
with the payment of various taxes, levies and local taxes, mainly property tax and other possible
contingencies, and the estimated consideration required to settle probable or certain liabilities and
outstanding obligations for which the exact amount of the corresponding payment cannot be determined or
for which the actual settlement date is not known, since they are contingent upon meeting certain terms.
These provisions have been provided in accordance with the specific analysis of the probability that the
related tax contingency or challenge might be contrary to the interests of the ACS Group, under the
consideration of the country in which it has its origin and in accordance with the tax rates in this country.
Since the timing for these provisions is dependent on certain facts, in some cases associated with the
decisions handed down by the courts or similar bodies, the Group does not update these provisions given
the uncertainty of the exact time in which the related risk may arise or disappear.

20.01.03. Provisions for third-party liabilities

These relate mainly to the following:

_Provisions for litigation_

These provisions cover the contingencies of the ACS Group companies that are party to certain legal
proceedings due to the liability inherent to the business activities carried on by them. The lawsuits, although
numerous, represent scantly material amounts when considered individually based on the size of the ACS
Group. Period charges to these provisions are made based on an analysis of the lawsuits or claims in
progress, according to the reports prepared by the legal advisers of the ACS Group. As in the case of
provisions for taxes, these amounts are not updated since the time at which the associated risk arises or
disappears depends on circumstances linked to court rulings or arbitration decisions and it is impossible to
determine the date on which they will be handed down. Additionally, these provisions are not derecognised
until the judgments handed down are final and payment is made or there is no doubt as to the
disappearance of the associated risk. The reduction between years is mainly due to the reassessment
carried out to cover operating risks, litigation and claims both in Spain and abroad, including guarantees for
possible claims related to assets sold. It should be noted that the Group operates in different businesses
and geographical areas with very specific sector regulations. Therefore, in the normal course of business, it
is exposed to lawsuits arising from claims relating to defects or delays in construction work or discrepancies
in costs and services provided. Some of these risks are covered by insurance policies, although the Group
makes certain additional provisions to mitigate the risks of deviation for those risks where it considers its
exposure to possible rulings other than those made locally to be high. Note 36 refers to the ACS Group’s
main contingencies.


-----

103

_Guarantees and contractual and legal obligations_

This heading includes the provisions to cover the expenses arising from contractual and legal obligations of
a non-environmental nature. A significant portion of these provisions is made by increasing the value of
those assets related to the obligations assumed in relation to administrative concession activities at the
beginning of the contractual agreement, which affect profit or loss when the asset concerned is depreciated
in accordance with the depreciation rates. Additionally, it includes provisions for toll road concession
operators, in relation to the costs of future expropriations borne by the concession operators in accordance
with agreements reached with the grantors, and the current value of the investments made in concession
arrangements (including improvements to infrastructure already foreseen and unavoidable in the initial
agreement), according to the respective financial and economic models.

Period charges to these provisions are mainly made to cover the costs associated with toll road concession
arrangements and other activities undertaken in the form of a concession. These provisions are made when
the associated commitments arise, with the timing of their use being associated with the use of the
infrastructure and/or its wear. Timing is analysed according to the financial and economic model of each
concession, considering related historical information to adjust for possible deviations that might arise in the
payment schedule set for these models.

The breakdown of provisions for third-party liabilities, by line of business, at 31 December 2023 is as
follows:

|Line of Business|Thousands of Euros|
|---|---|
|Construction Concessions Services Corporation and others|205,413 159,311 29,593 1,048,152|
|Total|1,442,469|


**Line of Business** **Thousands of Euros**

Construction 205,413

Concessions 159,311

Services 29,593

Corporation and others 1,048,152

**Total** **1,442,469**


The most significant provisions in the Construction area relate to the Hochtief Group, for which period
provisions were made at 31 December 2023 amounting to EUR 180,445 thousand (EUR 289,925 thousand
at 31 December 2022). These provisions include those for insured claims amounting to EUR 153,409
thousand (EUR 259,091 thousand at 31 December 2022). Provisions for insurance claims consist of both
liabilities for cover in the pre-claim phase and liabilities for claims incurred (claims phase after an insured
event occurs). These provisions are measured based on a series of estimates and assumptions, in
particular the estimate of future cash flows, and the procedures and data for determining both the discount
rate and the adjustment for non-financial risk. At each reporting date, the estimated cash flows for provisions
are remeasured using current discount rates. IFRS 17 provides for the option, applied at the portfolio level,
to recognise the impact of changes in discount rates and financial risk in other comprehensive income rather
than in the consolidated income statement. This is the option used at Hochtief.

In relation to Concessions, following the settlement agreement reached in 2023 regarding the process of
reclaiming Radials R3 and R5 (see Note 36), the agreement was implemented after it was signed (see Note
29).

The provision for the completion of the corresponding work, which is for the most part the budgeted or
estimated losses during the execution of the works associated with onerous contracts.

The provision for other ordinary operations relates mainly to provisions recorded for the construction
activities to cover risks and claims associated with the works.

**21. Financial risk and capital management**

In view of its activities, the ACS Group is exposed to various financial risks, mainly arising from the ordinary
course of its operations, the borrowings to finance its operating activities, and its investments in companies
with functional currencies other than the euro.

The main objective of financial risk management is to safeguard the ACS Group’s liquidity at all times. For
the ACS Group, liquidity does not only mean solvency in the strict sense of the term, but also the long-term
availability of the financial margin necessary for core operating activities. Consequently, the Group assess
the risks arising from market performance and how they may affect the consolidated financial statements.
The objective is to minimise any financial risks that may affect the value and profitability of the ACS Group.
Risk minimisation does not mean eliminating all financial risk, but rather substantially reducing it with
specific limits with quantifiable financial risk exposure at any given time. This serves to ensure a quick and
adaptive response should any unforeseen situations arise.

The financial risks to which the operating units are subject include mainly interest rate, foreign currency,
liquidity and credit risks. The ACS Group’s exposure to climate risk is described in Note 21.08 and in the
ACS Group’s Directors’ Report (especially in the Non-Financial Information Statement).

**_21.01._** **_Cash flow interest rate risk_**

This risk arises from changes in future cash flows relating to borrowings bearing interest at floating rates (or
with current maturity and likely renewal) as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates.

The objective of the management of this risk is to mitigate the impact on borrowing costs arising from
fluctuations in interest rates. For this purpose, financial derivatives that guarantee fixed interest rates or
rates with caps and floors are arranged for a substantial portion of the borrowings that may be affected by
this risk (see Note 22).

The sensitivity of the ACS Group’s profit and equity to changes in interest rates, taking into account its
existing hedging instruments and fixed rate financing, is as follows:

2022

**_21.02._** **_Foreign currency risk_**

Foreign currency risk arises mainly from the foreign operations of the ACS Group, which makes investments
and carries out business transactions in functional currencies other than the euro, and from loans granted to
Group companies in currencies other than those of the countries in which they are located.

To hedge the risk inherent to structural investments in foreign operations with a functional currency other
than the euro, the Group endeavours to make these investments in the same functional currency as the
assets being financed.

For the hedging of net positions in currencies other than the euro in the performance of contracts in force
and contracts in the backlog, the Group uses various financial instruments for the purpose of mitigating
exposure to foreign currency risk (see Note 22).

The sensitivity analysis shown below reflects the potential effect on the ACS Group, both on equity and on
the consolidated income statement, of a five per cent fluctuation in the most significant currencies in
comparison with the functional currency of each Group company, based on the situation at the end of the
reporting period.

**_21.03._** **_Liquidity risk_**

This risk arises from the timing differences between borrowing requirements for business investment
commitments, debt maturities, working capital requirements, etc. and the funds obtained from the conduct of
the Group’s ordinary operations, various forms of bank financing, capital market transactions and
divestments.

The ACS Group has a policy for proactively managing its liquidity risk, closely monitoring its cash and the
maturity of its financial obligations. The Group also manages liquidity risk through the efficient management
of investments and working capital and the arrangement of lines of long-term financing.


-----

107

The Group’s objective with respect to the management of liquidity risk to maintain a balance between the
flexibility, term and conditions of the credit facilities arranged on the basis of projected short-, medium-, and
long-term fund requirements. Noteworthy in this connection is the use of limited recourse project financing,
as described in Note 18, and current financing for working capital.

Certain transactions were carried out in 2023 that significantly reduced the liquidity risk of the ACS Group.
The following stand out:

– ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. renewed the Euro Commercial Paper (ECP)
programme for a maximum amount of EUR 750 million, the Negotiable European Commercial
Paper (NEU CP) programme for EUR 500 million, and the debt issuance programme known as Euro
Medium-Term Note Programme (EMTN Programme) for a maximum amount of EUR 1,500 million.

– Hochtief refinanced, before maturity, the existing long-term syndicated loan of EUR 1,700 million
maturing in 2024 and obtained another EUR 300 million for future corporate purposes, including the
refinancing of existing credit facilities. Hochtief and an international bank syndicate reached an
agreement for a credit facility with a five-year term from 30 March 2023 and options for an extension
of up to two additional years. The total amount is divided into EUR 1,200 million in guarantee lines,
EUR 500 million in credit facilities and EUR 300 million in loans.

– In early October 2023, Cimic repaid its credit facility of AUD 950 million (EUR 581 million) ahead of
schedule. In the process, Cimic entered into a new credit facility for AUD 625 million (EUR 383
million) with a three-year term and a credit facility for AUD 522 million (EUR 319 million) with a fiveyear term. Cimic was therefore able to increase its liquidity reserves on the whole by more than
AUD 267 million (EUR 164 million).

– In November 2023, Cimic signed a three-year syndicated bonding facility for AUD 1,300 million
(EUR 799 million). This facility replaces the credit facility of AUD 1,400 million (EUR 861 million) that
matured in March 2024 and covers the Cimic Group’s operational guarantee requirements in
addition to the existing bilateral guarantee and bonding facilities.

These refinancing transactions improved the liquidity of the ACS Group’s operations, which, combined with
the funds generated by its activities, will allow it to adequately fund its operations in 2024.

In November 2023, the credit rating agency Standard and Poor’s (S&P) confirmed that ACS, Actividades de
Construcción y Servicios, S.A. had a long-term corporate credit rating of BBB- and a short-term rating of
A-3, with a stable outlook. Hochtief and Cimic also obtained the same credit rating.

At 31 December 2023, “Other current financial assets” in the consolidated statement of financial position
(see Note 06) amounted to EUR 1,163,599 thousand (EUR 1,180,617 thousand at 31 December 2022), of
which EUR 957,248 thousand (EUR 986,911 thousand at 31 December 2022) could be settled in less than
three months, if the Group chooses to do so, due to the instrument’s own liquid nature or its own term. In
addition, the fair value of the forward contracts (settled by differences) relating to ACS shares amounting to
EUR 520,057 thousand at 31 December 2023 (EUR 239,178 thousand at 31 December 2022) are
considered to be liquid, since they may be disposed of at any time (see Note 22).

In relation to liquidity risk, it should be noted that at the Annual General Meeting held on 8 May 2020, the
shareholders agreed to delegate to the Board of Directors, in accordance with section 297.1(b) of the
consolidated text of the Corporate Enterprises Act, the power to increase, on one or more occasions, the
Company’s share capital up to a maximum of 50% of the share capital, as of the date of the Meeting, within
a maximum period of five years from the date of this General Meeting (see Note 15.01).

Lastly, as a precautionary measure against this risk, the shareholders at the ACS Group’s Annual General
Meeting held on 10 May 2019 approved a motion to delegate to the Board of Directors the power to issue,
on one or more occasions, within a maximum term of five years following 10 May 2019, securities
convertible into and/or exchangeable for shares of the Company, and warrants or other similar securities
that may directly or indirectly provide the right to the subscription or acquisition of the Company’s shares, for
a total amount of up to EUR 3,000 million; and the power to increase the share capital by the necessary


-----

108

amount, along with the power to exclude, where appropriate, the pre-emption rights up to a limit of 20% of
the share capital, as indicated in Note 15.01.

**_21.04._** **_Credit risk_**

The ACS Group is exposed to credit risk arising from its operations and certain financial activities. The
objective of credit risk management is to reduce the impact of customer defaults as far as possible by
means of the preventive assessment of the solvency rating of the Group’s potential customers. When
contracts are being performed, the credit quality of the outstanding amounts receivable is periodically
evaluated and the estimated recoverable amounts of doubtful receivables are adjusted and written down
with a charge to profit and loss for the year. The credit risk has historically been very limited.

In addition, the ACS Group is exposed to the risk of potential non-compliance by its counterparties in
transactions involving financial derivatives and cash placement. Corporate management of the ACS Group
establishes counterparty selection criteria based on the credit quality of the financial institutions, which
translates into a portfolio of entities of high quality and solvency.

The status of trade and other receivables that are past due but not impaired as at 31 December 2023 and
2022 is detailed below:

|Col1|Thousands of Euros|Col3|Col4|Col5|

The directors consider that these past-due balances, particularly those related to public bodies — over
which there are rights to demand payment for interest —, would not entail significant losses for the Group
considered on an individual basis.

**_21.05._** **_Exposure to publicly traded share price risk_**

The ACS Group is exposed to risks relating to the performance of the share price of listed companies.

The exposure in derivative contracts related to remuneration systems and in forward contracts settled by
differences tied to the performance of the ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. share price
(see Note 22) is noteworthy. Equity swaps ensure the exercise price of the remuneration systems, however,
since the derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, their market value has a negative impact on the
consolidated income statement only if the strike value offered to the beneficiaries decreases.

Changes in the price of the shares of listed companies, with regard to which the ACS Group has derivative
instruments, financial investments, etc., will have an impact on its consolidated income statement.

**_21.06._** **_Capital management_**

The ACS Group’s objectives in relation to capital management are to maintain an optimum financial and
equity structure to reduce the cost of capital and at the same time to safeguard the Group’s ability to
continue to operate with sufficiently sound debt-equity ratios.


-----

109

The capital structure is controlled mainly through the debt-equity ratio, calculated as net financial debt
divided by equity. Net financial debt is taken to be:

+ Net debt with recourse:

+ Non-current bank borrowings
+ Current bank borrowings
+ Issue of bonds and debentures
–  Cash and other current financial assets

+ Debt from the project finance and debt with limited recourse.

The Group’s directors consider that the gearing ratio at 31 December 2023 and 2022 was adequate, the
detail being as follows:

The decrease between years in assets included in level 1 is recognised under “Equity instruments” and is
due to the sale of Ventia shares during the year (see Note 02.02.f). The assets recognised under “Debt
securities” in level 1 are mainly from Hochtief and primarily relate to investments in securities, investment
funds and fixed-income securities maturing at more than three months, and that it does not intend to hold
until maturity (see Note 10.04).

Level 2 of the Fair Value Measurement Hierarchy includes all the ACS Group’s financial derivatives, such as
the forward contracts on ACS shares amounting to EUR 520,057 thousand (see Note 22), and other
financial assets and liabilities not listed on organised markets. They are measured internally on a quarterly
basis, using standard valuation techniques used in financial markets, compared against valuations received
from counterparties when necessary.

It should be noted that, depending on the nature of the derivative, the following methodologies are used:

– Interest rate hedges are measured using the zero-coupon rate curve, determined based on the
deposits and rates traded on the market at the reporting date to obtain discount factors and applying
it to the schedule of future flows from collections and payments.

– Derivatives where the underlying asset is quoted on an organised market and that are not qualified
as hedges are measured using the Black-Scholes methodology and applying market parameters
such as implicit volatility, repo costs, market interest rates and estimated dividends.

– For those derivatives where the underlying asset is quoted on an organised market, but the Group
intends to hold them to maturity, either because the derivative forms part of a financing agreement
or because its arrangement substitutes the underlying asset, the measurement is based on the
calculation of its intrinsic value at the reporting date.

As regards the assets included under “Debt securities” in level 2, it should be pointed out that these assets
relate mainly to liquidity surpluses allocated to the formalisation of fixed income securities maturing in more
than three months from the date of acquisition, which are highly liquid and high-rotation assets. These
amounts are mainly recognised in the Dragados division, amounting to EUR 94,972 thousand (EUR 62,706
thousand at 31 December 2022), and the Hochtief division, amounting to EUR 28,867 thousand (EUR
35,214 thousand at 31 December 2022).

The equity instruments classified under level 3, the fair value of which amounts to EUR 213,995 thousand
(EUR 161,456 thousand at 31 December 2022), relate mainly to unlisted financial assets. These assets
most notably include those from Hochtief amounting to EUR 178,904 thousand (EUR 137,471 thousand at
31 December 2022), which were measured using discounted cash flow techniques. The non-observable
data used for this purpose are an internal rate of return of 9%, growth rates of between 2.5% and 3.0%, and
discount rates of between 8% and 15%.


-----

111

The financial instrument payables included in level 3 comprise the valuations of the derivative instruments
relating to the put option for Elliott to sell all or part of its 50% interest in Thiess to Cimic and the put option
that Elliott has to sell its class C preference shares in Thiess to Cimic as detailed in Note 22.

The changes in financial instruments included under Level 3 in 2023 are as follows:

The loans to third parties classified under level 3 in 2022 related to the earn-out from the sale of most of the
Industrial Services Division (see Note 03.09.02).

No derivative instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss were transferred between levels 1
and 2 of the fair value hierarchy in 2023 or in 2022.

The Group has not detailed the fair value of certain financial instruments, such as “Trade receivables for
sales and services” and “Trade payables”, as their carrying amount approximates their fair value.

**_21.08. Climate change risk. Risk management and opportunities related to climate change_**

To respond to the need for comprehensive and uniform risk management, ACS has established a model that
includes the identification, assessment, classification, measurement, management and follow-up of risks
throughout the Group and its operating divisions. These identified risks are used to create a risk map that is
regularly updated based on the different variables included in it and on the ACS Group’s areas of activity.

Therefore, in keeping with its commitment to continuous improvement, during the year the ACS Group
continued to analyse and assess the most significant risks and to identify any opportunities, based on the
exercise presented in the previous year’s report. In 2023, following the recommendations of the Task Force
on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), different climate scenarios and time horizons were used
to assess climate risks and opportunities, using a proven methodology.

The risks arising from climate change identified can therefore be classified as follows:

– Physical risks are those that arise from the physical effects of climate change. They are considered
acute if they arise from specific weather and climate events, and chronic if they arise from more
gradual changes in climate patterns.

– Transition risks are the risks that arise from adapting business models to a decarbonised economy.
These risks are interconnected and their identification is important for stakeholders, especially
investors, since inaction in the face of these risks may have operational and financial
consequences. These risks include legal, technological, market and reputational risks.


-----

112

Climate-related opportunities arise both from the transition to a low-carbon economy and from adaptation to
physical risks. These opportunities can be classified into five categories: opportunities related to energy
efficiency, adoption of low-carbon energy sources, development of new products, access to new markets
and resilience of the activities and assets of the Company and through the supply chain.

Although the full detail of the most significant risks and opportunities identified can be found in chapter 5.1 of
the Directors’ Report of the ACS Group’s consolidated Annual Accounts for 2023 and 2022, a summary of
the scenarios, time horizons used and their probabilities is shown below:

– **Physical risks: the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on**
Climate Change (IPCC) in its last assessment report (AR6) were taken as a reference together with
the CORDEX information with high spatial resolution in their Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The
time horizon analysed for physical risks was updated in accordance with the recommendations of
the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS1). Accordingly, the time horizons analysed
were historical evolution (1986-2015) and future periods (2020-2049 and 2036-2065).

– For these scenarios and time horizons, a quantitative analysis of more than 80 representative
projects relating to construction, services, concessions and natural resources activities was carried
out, covering the Group’s entire geographical deployment scope and various climate types.

– The ACS Group bases its Risk Control System on a range of strategic and operational actions to
mitigate these risks and fulfil the objectives set by the Company's Board. Therefore, as regards the
risks relating to climate change, the main risk management and mitigation measures are determined
by the commitments and basic guiding principles defined in the ACS Group’s Environmental Policy
and in the strategic lines and objectives set out in the ACS Group’s 2025 Sustainability Master Plan.

– Consequently, unlike with the 2022 analysis, in 2023 the study incorporated the broad diversity of
climate risk management measures that the Group’s various subsidiaries customarily implement in
their activities.

The main conclusion drawn from the analysis is that the application of measures to address climate risk,
including transfer of risk to the customer, specific insurance, contractual climate risk hedging clauses,
specific health and safety measures, the use of early warning systems or physical measures to address
climate impacts, means that for any of the scenarios, horizons and activities considered, the physical risk
associated with climate is low or very low.

– **Transition risks: the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE)**
scenarios of the International Energy Agency (IEA) were taken as a reference. The following time
horizons have been updated for transition risks in accordance with the transition scenarios
analysed: 2022-2035 and 2036-2050.

– During the year, work was carried out based on the transition risks identified in 2022. Accordingly,
some regulatory and market transition risks were identified for the 2022-2035 period for the
construction activity. These risks are very low or low for the two scenarios considered and medium
for other reputational or market risks, especially for the 2036-2050 period. However, similar to the
2022 study on physical risks, this analysis on transition risks did not include an assessment of the
measures the Group has in place to mitigate their potential effects.

– In 2023, work was carried out mainly to identify these ongoing measures and assess their impact on
mitigating potential transition risks.

– As can be inferred from the summary table on transition risks included in section 5.1., the ACS
Group currently has a variety of measures (decarbonisation plans in various subsidiaries,
communication and awareness-raising actions, actions for rapid adaptation to the new regulation or
anticipation of changes in the market) that enable it to face possible transition risks with assurances,
in all the scenarios and time horizons analysed.

– **Opportunities: the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE)**
scenarios of the International Energy Agency (IEA) were taken as a reference. The following time
horizons have been updated for the opportunities in accordance with the transition scenarios
analysed: 2022-2035 and 2036-2050. Based on the 2022 analysis, a detailed analysis has been


-----

113

carried out to identify and quantify climate-related opportunities for the Group. The changes in and
trend of the Group’s portfolio in key sectors and the general trends of the potential market have
therefore been analysed based on studies by independent entities.

The overall conclusion is that the opportunities associated with global needs for new infrastructure making it
possible to achieve net zero emissions targets by 2050, together with the global targets set in order to close
the climate change adaptation gap, may far outweigh the potential physical and transitional risks to the
Group. Regarding potential physical and transitional risks, the Group’s opportunity lies in having the
competitive advantage of designing, building, repurposing and operating sustainable and climate-resilient
infrastructure for its customers or for its PPP/concession projects by considering and analysing mitigation
and adaptation measures and using new materials or technologies that support a project’s climate resilience
over its lifetime. In addition, due to its large size, the Group is ideally positioned to develop a more climateresilient supply chain model by collaborating with its suppliers.

For example, over the last year, energy transition projects have doubled, to a total of EUR 4,152 million.
Within this sector, the following projects stand out: batteries (electric vehicle factories, storage parks) have
increased by a factor of 2.8, and power transmission and related facilities have tripled. In addition, the ACS
Group has shown leadership through the growth its sales revenue in construction projects awarded with
sustainable certification in recent years, with a 6% year-on-year increase. In 2023, sales in this sector
reached EUR 14,087 million, currently accounting for 42.2% of total construction activity.

Taxonomy in the Non-Financial Information Statement in the ACS Group’s Consolidated Directors’ Report
for 2023.

**22. Derivative financial instruments**

The details of the financial instruments at 31 December 2023 and 2022 are as follows:

**Total** **612,316** **38,392** **365,029** **155,106**


The assets and liabilities designated as hedging instruments include the amount corresponding to the
effective part of the changes in fair value of these instruments designated and classified as cash flow
hedges. They relate mainly to interest rate hedges (interest rate swaps) and foreign exchange rate hedges,
tied to asset and liability items in the statement of financial position, and to future transaction commitments
qualifying for hedge accounting.

The ACS Group’s different lines of business expose it to financing risks, mainly foreign currency and interest
rate risks. To minimise the impact of these risks and in accordance with its risk management policy (see
Note 21), the ACS Group has arranged various financial derivatives, most of which have non-current
maturities.

The Group does not have any hedges of its foreign investments, since the foreign currency risk is hedged
by the transactions performed in the local currency. Additionally, most significant foreign investments were
made with long-term financing in which the interest rates on project financing debt are hedged.

**Cash flow hedges (interest rate)**

The purpose of using these derivatives is to limit changes in interest rates on its borrowings and to
guarantee fixed interests rates, mainly by arranging interest rate swaps as the borrowings are arranged and
used.

Most hedges are interest rate swaps that expire at the same time or slightly sooner than the underlying that
they are hedging.

Hedges of this type are mainly related to the various loans within the Group and to project and other noncurrent financing, both at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 (see Notes 17 and 18).

In relation to its long-term loans, ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. has arranged hedges
in the amount of EUR 940,000 thousand that relate to the hedge of the syndicated loan maturing in
September 2026 (hedges amounting to EUR 1,143,000 thousand at 31 December 2022).

**Cash flow hedges (exchange rate)**

Foreign currency risk relates mainly to projects in which payments and/or collections are made in a currency
other than the functional currency.

In 2018, new hedging transactions were carried out to mitigate foreign currency risks in projects in North
America where payments will have to be made in a currency other than that corresponding to the collections
and maturing in 2025.

Also of note, due to their importance, are the derivatives arranged by Hochtief for a notional amount of EUR
1,206,829 thousand, which primarily mature after 2027 (EUR 1,269,851 thousand in 2022, maturing mainly
after 2026).

**Derivative instruments not classified as hedges**

The assets and liabilities relating to derivative financial instruments not qualified as hedges include the fair
value of those derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

A new ACS share option plan and an ACS share plan for the next 5 years (2023-2028 Plan) were
established in the second half of 2023 and have been outsourced to a financial institution (see Note 28.03).
The financial institution holds these shares to be delivered to executives who are beneficiaries of the plan in
accordance with the conditions included in the plan and at the exercise price of the option (EUR 31.55 per
share). To ensure the exercise price of the remuneration systems, the Company has arranged two equity
swaps linked to the remuneration plan referred to above. These derivatives do not meet the accounting
requirements to qualify for hedge accounting, therefore their measurement is recorded by means of
changes in the consolidated income statement. The change in fair value of these instruments is included
under “Changes in fair value of financial instruments” in the accompanying consolidated income statement
(see Note 28.04). Pursuant to the contracts with the financial institutions, the latter do not assume any risk
arising from the drop in the share price below the exercise price. Since ACS’s share price at 31 December
2023 is higher than the exercise price of the option, no liability in this connection has been recognised in the
consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023 given that the adjustment, if necessary,
would be in favour of the plan beneficiary (EUR 129,962 thousand recognised on the liability side under
“Current derivative financial instruments” at 31 December 2022). In the first half of 2023, the 2018 ACS
share option plan ended (see Note 28.03), with a positive impact on the 2023 income statement in the
amount of EUR 62,975 thousand (see Note 28.04).

At 31 December 2023, ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. has a forward derivative
contract, settled by differences, on its own shares with a financial institution for a maximum total of


-----

116

12,731,731 shares, adjustable on the basis of future dividends, and 111 maturities, with the last maturity
date in February 2025 at a rate of 114,700 shares per session. In addition, at 31 December 2023 the
Company had another forward derivative contract, settled by differences, on 12,705,666 shares, adjustable
on the basis of future ACS dividends, with the last maturity date in August 2024, at a rate of 115,117 shares
per session. After the reporting date, ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. renewed the latter
contract, to be settled, also by differences, between 27 February 2025 and 5 August 2025 at 115,094 shares
per session (see Notes 10.05 and 28.04).

The positive fair value of the forward contracts (settled by differences) related to ACS shares amounted to
EUR 520,057 thousand at 31 December 2023 (EUR 239,178 thousand at 31 December 2022) and was
recognised under “Current derivative financial instruments” on the asset side of the accompanying
consolidated statement of financial position, following the impact of the re-strike of the forward contract for
EUR 80 million. The effect on the income statement in 2023 is a profit of EUR 360,885 thousand (a profit of
EUR 123,737 thousand in 2022) recognised under “Changes in fair value of financial instruments” in the
accompanying consolidated income statement (see Note 28.04).

The amounts provided as security (see Note 10.05) relating to the above derivatives arranged by the Group
amounted to EUR 163,406 thousand at 31 December 2023 (EUR 218,139 at 31 December 2022).

As part of the divestment of Thiess, the transaction agreement included a put option for Elliott to sell all or
part of its 50% interest in Thiess (Class A preference shares or ordinary shares) to Cimic after the third year,
i.e., four to six years after the sale on 31 December 2020. The exercise price will be the lower of the cost
price or a price tied to changes in the S&P / ASX 200 Total Return Index plus the cumulative value of any
shortfall in the minimum agreed distributions. This option has no current impact on the control of the
company.

The put option is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument in accordance with IFRS 9 and is
therefore recognised at fair value through profit or loss in the ACS Group’s consolidated financial
statements.

The fair value of the put option cannot be assessed using the market price. A probability-weighted expected
return methodology is used to obtain the value of the income from the put option based on future potential
payments if the option is exercised, adjusted for minimum annual distributions as per the shareholders’
agreement, and compared to the estimated exercise price to determine a fair value. The fair value of the put
option was determined by an external independent advisor. At 31 December 2023, the fair value of the put
option was determined to be AUD 0, equivalent to EUR 0 (AUD 4.35 million, equivalent to EUR 2.77 million
at 31 December 2022).

The input parameters assumed for the measurement were an expected exercise period of zero to three
years, an EBITDA multiplier of 3 to 5 times and discount rates of between 10% and 15%. There were no
significant interrelationships between unobservable inputs that could have a material effect on fair value.
Changes in these data did not have a material effect on total comprehensive income, total assets and
liabilities, or equity.

As indicated in Note 5, in 2022 Thiess issued Class C preference shares providing a coupon yield above all
other equity instruments in the amount of EUR 14.0 million (EUR 3.2 million in 2022) for the Group’s
shareholding. Therefore, there are agreements relating to Thiess Class C preference shares. Under the
agreement, Elliott has the option to sell its Class C preference shares to Cimic within 42 months. The term
begins six months after the period for exercising the put option expires or six months after the date on which
Elliott ceases to hold Class A preference shares or ordinary shares or announces that it will exercise the
option to sell all remaining shares (the “Thiess option”).

Cimic has a call option to purchase Elliott’s Class C preference shares for a period of 42 months, which
begins at the end of the period for exercising the put option or the date on which Elliott ceases to hold the
shares.

The Thiess option is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument in accordance with IFRS 9 and is
therefore recognised at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of the Thiess option was determined
by an external independent advisor.

The fair value of the Thiess option cannot be assessed using the market price. The Thiess option is valued
using the net present value methodology taking into account the probability-based outcomes of both the put
and call options. The assumptions used for the measurement were an expected exercise period of three to
seven years and discount rates of between 10% and 15%. There were no significant interrelationships
between unobservable inputs that could have a material effect on fair value. Changes in these parameters
did not have a material effect on total comprehensive income, total assets and liabilities, or equity.

At 31 December 2023, the fair value of the Thiess option was determined to be AUD 1.62 million, equivalent
to EUR 1 million (AUD 1.68 million, equivalent to EUR 1.07 million at 31 December 2022).

The Group has recognised both its own credit risk and that of the counterparty based on each derivative for
all derivative instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, in accordance with IFRS 13.

**23. Trade and other payables**

This heading mainly includes the amounts outstanding for trade purchases and related costs, and customer
advances for contract work amounting to EUR 2,474,242 thousand in 2023 (EUR 2,422,566 thousand in
2022) (see Note 12) and the amount of the work billed in advance totalling EUR 620,915 thousand in 2023
(EUR 469,716 thousand in 2022).

The Group has entered into reverse factoring arrangements and supply chain financing agreements (as they
are called in other countries) with various financial institutions to facilitate, at their discretion, early payment
to its suppliers, under which suppliers may exercise their collection rights with the Group companies or
entities, obtaining the amount invoiced less the finance costs of discounting and the fees charged by those
financial institutions. The amount drawn down against the reverse factoring arrangements and supply chain
financing agreements totalled EUR 459,976 thousand at 31 December 2023 (EUR 701,833 thousand at 31
December 2022). These arrangements do not change the main terms and conditions of payment to
suppliers and, therefore, they continue to be classified as trade payables.

**Disclosures on the period of payment to suppliers. Final Provision Two of Spanish Law 31/2014, of 3**
**December**

The following is a summary of the disclosures required by Final Provision Two of Law 31/2014, of 3
December, which was prepared in accordance with Spanish Accounting and Audit Institute Resolution of 29
January 2016, on the disclosures to be included in the annual accounts in relation to the average period of
payment to suppliers in commercial transactions in Spain:

In addition, the information required by Spanish Law 18/2022, of 28 September, on the creation and growth
of companies (Ley 18/2022 de Creación y Crecimiento de Empresas) regarding invoices paid within a
period less than the maximum established in the regulations on late payment in Spain is detailed as follows:

|Col1|Period 2023|Period 2022|
|---|---|---|
|Monetary amount paid in thousands of euros in a period lower than the maximum established in the late payment regulations|1,642,687|1,445,426|
|Percentage of total monetary payments made to suppliers|98.4 %|99.1 %|
|Number of invoices paid in a period lower than the maximum established in the regulations on late payment.|503,213|469,581|
|Percentage over total number of invoices paid to suppliers|97.7 %|97.5 %|


**Period 2023** **Period 2022**

Monetary amount paid in thousands of euros in a period lower than the
1,642,687 1,445,426
maximum established in the late payment regulations

Percentage of total monetary payments made to suppliers 98.4 % 99.1 %

Number of invoices paid in a period lower than the maximum established in
503,213 469,581
the regulations on late payment.

Percentage over total number of invoices paid to suppliers 97.7 % 97.5 %


The figures shown in the above tables in relation to payments to suppliers relate to suppliers that, because
of their nature, are trade creditors for the supply of goods and services and, therefore, they include the
figures relating to “Trade and other payables - Suppliers” under current liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated statement of financial position, which does not include accounts payable for reverse factoring
amounting to EUR 719,647 thousand.

“Average period of payment to suppliers” is taken to be the period that elapses from the delivery of the
goods or the provision of the services by the supplier to the effective payment of the transaction. This
“Average period of payment to suppliers” is calculated as the quotient where the numerator is the sum of the
ratio of transactions paid multiplied by the total amount of payments made plus the ratio of transactions not
yet paid multiplied by the total amount of payments outstanding, and where the denominator is the total
amount of payments made and payments outstanding.

The ratio of transactions paid is calculated as the quotient where the numerator is the sum of the products of
multiplying the amounts paid by the number of days until payment, and where the denominator is the total
amount of payments made. Number of days until payment is understood to mean the number of calendar
days that have elapsed from the date on which calculation of the period began until the effective payment of
the transaction.

Likewise, the ratio of transactions not yet paid corresponds to the quotient where the numerator is the sum
of the products of multiplying the amounts payable by the number of days of outstanding payment, and
where the denominator is the total amount of payments outstanding. Number of days of outstanding
payment is understood to mean the number of calendar days that have elapsed from the date on which
calculation of the period began until the last day of the period of the annual accounts.

The Group will use the date of receipt of the products or provision of the services to begin calculating the
period for both the number of days until payment and the number of days of outstanding payment. In the
absence of reliable information as to when this circumstance occurs, the Company will use the date of
receipt of the invoice. In the event that any financing is made available to creditors that allows for early
payment, the date of the drawdown by the creditors will be considered to be the date of payment, provided
that the cost is borne by the customer and there is no possibility of recourse to the supplier in the event of
non-payment.

**24. Other current liabilities**

This heading of the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023 amounting to EUR
441,997 thousand (EUR 336,288 thousand at 31 December 2023) includes — in addition to EUR 214,876
thousand, of which EUR 191,953 thousand relate to reverse factoring arrangements issued for the payment
of invoices to foreign suppliers — other items such as prepayments, payments to non-current asset
suppliers, deposits and guarantees received, and amounts relating to current accounts with joint ventures

**25. Segments**

**_25.01._** **_Basis of segmentation_**

The structure of the ACS Group reflects its focus on different lines of business or activity areas. Segment
reporting based on the different lines of business includes information regarding the Group’s internal
organisation, taking into account the bodies involved in monitoring operations and taking decisions.

25.01.01. Primary segments - business segments

In accordance with the ACS Group’s internal organisational structure and, consequently, its internal
reporting structure, in 2023 the Group carried on its business activities through lines of business, which are
the operating reporting segments as indicated in IFRS 8.

The main areas of the Group are divided into:

**_a) Construction_**

The Construction business segment includes the construction activities through Dragados and Hochtief
(including Cimic) and is aimed at carrying out all types of civil construction projects (activities related to
developing infrastructure, such as highways, railways, maritime projects and airports), building projects
(residential buildings, social infrastructure and facilities) and infrastructures services (railway, transport,
communications and technology, such as data centres, energy, such as battery factories, resources, water
and defence sectors). The geographical regions with the greatest exposure in this area are North America,
Asia Pacific and Europe, mainly operating in developed markets that are safe from a geopolitical,
macroeconomic and legal perspective.

**_b) Concessions_**

The Concessions business segment includes the activities of Iridium and the shareholdings in Abertis and is
focused on the development and operation of transport concessions. These projects are carried out either
through direct construction models for public and private customers, or through public-private partnership
models, where the ACS Group is involved in the entire value chain of the concessions business, from the
design of the project to its financing, construction, start-up, and operation. The geographical regions with the
greatest exposure in this area are Europe, Latin America and North America.

**_c) Services_**

This area only includes Clece’s business activity, which offers comprehensive maintenance services for
buildings, public places and organisations, and assistance to people. This area is mainly based in Spain but
also shows incipient growth in the European market. Although this segment does not meet the quantitative
thresholds established in IFRS 8, the Group considers that it should be reported as a differentiated segment
since the nature of the goods and services it provides is wholly differentiated and identifiable, it reports
independently to the Group, and this presentation is considered to be more useful to the users of the
financial statements.

**_d) Corporate and others_**

This includes the activity of the Group’s Parent Company, ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios,
S.A., in addition to other activities that cannot be assigned to the other business segments that are
presented separately, such as the property assets developed by Cogesa and the renewable energy and
water assets, plus the effects of consolidation.

25.01.02 Geographical segments

The ACS Group is managed by business segments and the management based on geographical segments
is irrelevant. Accordingly, a distinction is made between Spain and the rest of the world, in accordance with
IFRS 8.

**_25.02._** **_Basis and methodology for business segment reporting_**

The reporting structure is designed in accordance with the effective management of the various segments
comprising the ACS Group. Each division has its own resources based on the entities engaging in the
related business activity and, accordingly, has the assets required to carry on the activity.

Each of the business segments relates mainly to a legal structure, in which the companies report to a
holding company representing each activity for business purposes. Accordingly, each legal entity has the
assets and resources required to carry on its business activities in an autonomous manner.

Segment reporting of these activities, before allocation of expenses to subsidiaries in the income statement,
is presented below, in accordance with the Group’s management criteria following its internal organisation
and taking into account the bodies involved in monitoring operations and taking decisions.

**26. Tax matters**

**_26.01._** **_Consolidated Tax Group_**

Pursuant to current law, ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. is the Parent Company of Tax
Group 30/99, which includes the Spanish subsidiaries in which the Parent Company has a direct or indirect
ownership interest of at least 75% and that meet the requirements provided for in Spanish regulations
governing the tax consolidation regime.

The Group’s other subsidiaries file individual tax returns in accordance with the tax law in force in each
country, either individually or with groups of companies, such as in the US or Australia.

**_26.02.   Reconciliation of the current income tax expense to accounting profit_**

The reconciliation of the income tax expense for continuing operations resulting from the application of the
standard tax rate in force in Spain to the current tax expense recognised, and the determination of the
average effective tax rate, are as follows:

Current tax income expense 216,703 75,894

Effective rate, excluding equity method 27.5% 26.9%


The permanent differences in both 2023 and 2022 are mainly due to tax exempt income.

The tax credits basically include both double taxation tax credits and tax credits for donations and those for
R&D activities carried out in Spain and in other countries.

The effect of the spread between national tax rates and the reference tax rate of 25% is due to the fact that
the nominal Spanish rate used to calculate this table is lower than the average nominal rates in the relevant
countries in which the Group operates.

The corporation tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2023 included the result of the Constitutional
Court’s 18 January 2024 judgment in the calculation of tax loss carryforwards for the period. This judgment
declared unconstitutional the limits imposed on tax loss carryforwards introduced by Royal Decree Law
3/2016 for taxpayers with the tax profile of the Parent and its consolidated tax group (carryforward limited to
25% of taxable profit). The judgement therefore required returning the previous year’s rule on the limit of tax
loss carryforwards to 70% of taxable profit, which is the criterion applied by the Parent for calculating its tax
for the period for the individual company and for the tax group.

The expense relating to deferred tax assets generated in the year and not recognised in 2023 and 2022 is a
result mainly of the decision not to recognise the tax assets associated with the tax losses in certain
jurisdictions, while income from the application of deferred tax assets from previous years is due to the use
of tax losses by the Spanish Tax Group whose deferred tax assets were not recognised.

In addition, no tax expense was incurred in 2023 or 2022 in relation to profit from discontinued operations.

**_26.04._** **_Taxes recognised in equity_**

In addition to the tax effects recognised in the consolidated income statement, in 2023 a credit of EUR
16,808 thousand was recognised directly in the Group’s equity (a charge of EUR 59,310 thousand in 2022).
These amounts relate to tax effects of adjustments to financial assets through other comprehensive income,
with a charge of EUR 6,857 thousand in 2023 (credit of EUR 18,451 thousand in 2022), cash flow
derivatives, with a credit of EUR 17,501 thousand in 2023 (charge of EUR 29,697 thousand in 2022),
actuarial losses, with a credit of EUR 4,771 thousand in 2023 (charge of EUR 47,543 thousand in 2022) and
translation differences, with a credit of EUR 1,393 thousand in 2023 (charge of EUR 521 thousand in 2022).

The deferred tax assets were recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position because the
Group’s directors considered that, based on their best estimate of the Group’s future earnings, it is probable
that these assets will be recovered.

The deferred tax liabilities, amounting to EUR 331,991 thousand (EUR 294,346 thousand at 31 December
2022), have not substantially changed with respect to 31 December 2022, as the effect of the amendment to
IAS 12, the application of which is mandatory as of 1 January 2023, is not material.

Hochtief completed the acquisition of all Cimic shares on 10 June 2022. Effective as of this date, Cimic
Group Limited and its wholly-owned Australian entities became part of the Hochtief Australia Holdings
Limited multiple entry consolidated (“MEC”) group for tax purposes, with Hochtief Australia Holdings Limited
as the head of the MEC group. Under the new tax group, the parent company and the subsidiaries continue
to account for their own current and deferred taxes. These tax amounts are measured as if each entity of the
consolidated tax group were still an independent taxpayer. The parent company recognises current tax
liabilities or assets and deferred tax liabilities or assets arising from unused tax loss carryforwards and
unused tax assets assumed by the subsidiaries of the tax consolidation group.

Following Cimic’s inclusion in the MEC group, the regulations applicable in Australia, i.e. the Income Tax
Assessment Act 1997, require that the tax values of the Cimic group’s assets be adjusted in accordance
with tax cost adjustment principles. The company was assisted by external advisors in performing this
calculation. The accounting profit resulting from the change of tax group amounted to EUR 48.8 million net
of the tax effect. The net impact is the result of a series of offsetting adjustments to readjust certain tax
bases related mainly to financial investments, inventories, and property, plant and equipment. This effect is
offset by the impairment losses for deferred tax assets arising from tax losses.

Pursuant to current regulations, deferred tax assets arising from temporary difference are not subject to
expiration periods.

Furthermore, as regards the tax assets arising from tax losses, their use is subject to various conditions and
periods established by the different applicable national regulations. However, there is no statutory limitation
period in the vast majority of jurisdictions where losses have been incurred.

In turn, tax credit carryforwards corresponding to the Spanish Tax Group, included on the asset side of the
consolidated statement of financial position in the amount of EUR 55,050 thousand (EUR 63,711 thousand
in 2022), are set to expire according to the type of asset as set out in the Spanish Corporation Tax Act (Ley
_del Impuesto sobre Sociedades). The unused tax credits in 2023 mainly relate to tax credits arising between_
2011 and 2015 for reinvestment of capital gains, the statutory limitation period of which is 15 years.

As regards the tax credits of the Spanish Tax Group, an impairment test is carried out every year to
determine which tax credits are used by the Group within the expiration period.

The key assumptions of this test, which are consistent with those applied in previous years, were as follows:

– Profit before tax, calculated based on taxable profit, of the business areas in Spain that, with respect
to that obtained in 2023, increases for subsequent years at annual rates of 3%.

– General maintenance of the scope of consolidation of companies in the Tax Group.

– The finance charge for the Group’s corporate debt in Spain was specifically recalculated taking into
account the new breakdown of this debt and a reduction at an average annual rate of 2% was
estimated for subsequent years.

– The minimum tax rate of 15% of taxable profit was taken into account and a maximum of 25% of
adjusted gross tax liability was set regarding the use of the gross tax liability adjusted by tax credits
for R&D, reinvestment and others.

The Group has considered, in relation to the analysis of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the main
positive and negative factors that apply to the recognition of these assets, identifying that the following
factors, among others, are met:

Positive factors

– History of recurring profits by the tax group.

– Existence of new business opportunities for the tax group. Having a solid portfolio.

– The Group is not a start-up.

– Compliance with business plans and profit forecasts in the coming financial years.


-----

129

– Some of the businesses that make up the tax group are not very complex in terms of making
projections.

Negative factors

– The longer the recovery time, the less reliable the estimate will be.

– Long offsetting periods do not guarantee that deferred tax assets will be reversed in full because a
company or tax group could generate new losses in the future or cease to be a going concern. In
the case of the ACS Spanish tax group, it has a history of recurring profits and a solid future
portfolio, so this negative factor does not apply and the loss was a one-off operating event.

On the basis of these assumptions, the tax assets of the Spanish Tax Group recognised in the statement of
financial position would be used before they expire. However, it is worth noting that significant negative
deviations between the above profits and the estimates used in the impairment test, in overall terms, i.e.,
that may not be offset by subsequent positive deviations within the expiration period, could represent a
recoverability risk as regards the tax credits. In particular, based on the test performed, negative changes in
the Spanish Tax Group’s attributable profit, in overall (not specific) terms, throughout the relevant period,
with respect to the average of those generated in the last two years, would determine the beginning of the
partial expiration of the tax credits.

In addition to the amounts recognised on the asset side of the consolidated statement of financial position,
as detailed in the table above, the Group has other deferred tax assets and tax loss and tax credit
carryforwards not recognised on the asset side of the consolidated statement of financial position because it
is not possible to predict the future flows of economic benefits, the breakdown and expiration period of
which are shown in the table below.

Of these amounts, the tax asset for uncapitalised losses attributable to the Spanish tax group amounted to
EUR 847,239 thousand, of which EUR 362,015 thousand were generated in Spain and the rest abroad, with
EUR 630,820 thousand from the Hochtief Group.

**_26.06_** **_Tax audits_**

Under the current law, taxes cannot be considered to have been definitely settled until the tax returns filed
have been reviewed by the tax authorities or until the limitation period has expired.

In July 2023, the Group was notified that tax audits were being commenced on the Spanish tax group in
relation to corporation tax, from 2018 to 2021, and VAT and withholdings, from 2019 to 2021. In view of the
varying interpretations that can be made of the tax rules, this could result in tax liabilities that cannot be
objectively quantified at the present time. However, the ACS Group’s directors do not consider that any
significant contingent liabilities in relation to the Group’s profit could arise from any tax audit carried out.

On 15 December 2022, the European Council approved Directive 2022/2523 establishing a minimum level
of taxation for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups. The objective of this rule,
which will first be applicable in 2024, is for large enterprise groups to be taxed in all jurisdictions in which
they operate at a minimum tax rate of 15%. Although the Directive has yet to be transposed into Spanish
law, it has been transposed in Germany, where it is fully in force.

Given that the ACS Group falls within the scope of application of this new tax, the impact that it will have has
been assessed in accordance with the latest information available in the Country-by-Country Report, and
with the financial information for 2023. According to this information, the effect is expected to be very limited,
given that practically all the jurisdictions in which the Group operates have tax rates higher than the
minimum rate of 15%. However, the ACS Group will continue to assess this matter in its future financial
statements.

**ACS**

On 27 July 2023, the Board of ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A., using the authorisation
granted by the shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting held on 5 May 2023, and following a
favourable report from the Remuneration Committee, approved the Long-Term Incentive Plan for ACS
Group executives, covering a period of five years (2023-2028) and with the following main characteristics:


-----

134

a. Plan involving the delivery of shares of ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. (LongTerm Incentive Plan 1, “LTIP1”) or purchase options on the Company’s own shares (Long-Term
Incentive Plan 2, “LTIP2”). Specifically, LTIP1 is a share-based plan that is limited to executives of
ACS and Group subsidiaries who have no other long-term incentive plan in their compensation
scheme (as is the case of Hochtief and its subsidiaries); by contrast, LTIP2 is a share option plan
that is offered to executives throughout the Group, including the main subsidiaries over which the
Group has operational control.

b. A total of 1,120,000 shares are covered by LTIP1. The beneficiaries are 131 executives with the
right to receive from 100,000 to 1,150 shares.

c. A maximum of 10,000,000 shares will be covered by the share option plan (LTIP2). The
beneficiaries are 229 executives with the right to exercise from 590,000 to 5,000 options.

d. In the case of shares (LTIP1), the price is considered the last quoted price before the delivery date.
The acquisition price of the options will be EUR 31.55 per share. This price will change by the
corresponding amount should a dilution take place.

e. Beneficiaries may exercise the rights during the last two years and subject to a service condition.

f. The rights may be exercised up until 30 June 2028:

i. For LTIP1, the shares will be delivered in two instalments: the first half in July 2026 and the
second half in July 2027.

ii. For LTIP2, the options may be exercised in two equal parts, which can be simultaneous if
the beneficiary so wishes, during the fourth and fifth years from 1 July 2023.

g. For each beneficiary to receive shares or exercise options granted, in addition to meeting the
service condition, the operational, financial and sustainability performance of the ACS Group during
the calculation period must meet the Group’s objectives. The criteria chosen for meeting these
objectives are:

1. With a weighting of 40%, the total shareholder return (TSR) over the period (2023-2025)
must be higher than the median of the main companies in the sector with a stock market
capitalisation and international status comparable to ACS (these companies are detailed in
Appendix 1). In this case, the executive receives 100% of the rights allocated under this
criterion. If the TSR over this period is less than the 25th percentile of the comparable
sample, the executive receives no rights under this criterion. If the TSR is between the 25th
and 50th percentile of the sample, the number of rights received by the executive will be
proportional to result within this range (0% for the 25th percentile and 100% for the 50th
percentile).

2. With a weighting of 40%, the average return on equity (ROE) of the ACS Group in
2023-2025, measured as the percentage of net profit over equity for the previous year (Net
Profit n / Equity n-1), must above 10%. If the result is lower, no rights will be granted to the
executive.

3. With a weighting of 20%, the average percentile obtained in the DJSI in 2023-2025 must be
greater than 85%. In this case, the executive receives 100% of the rights allocated under
this criterion. If the average DJSI percentile in the measurement period is less than the 60th
percentile, the executive receives no rights under this criterion. If the result for ACS is
between the 60th and 85th percentile, the number of rights received by the executive will be
proportional to result within this range (0% for the 60th percentile and 100% for the 85th
percentile).

Tax withholdings, expenses and the taxes payable as a result of exercising the shares and the share options
will be borne exclusively by the beneficiaries.


-----

135

The ACS Group’s previous share option plan (granted in 2018) ended in June 2023 without the options
being exercised.

Share-based remuneration, which is recognised as personnel expenses in the consolidated income
statement with a balancing entry in equity, amounts to EUR 6,946 thousand in 2023, of which EUR 4,710
thousand relates to the 2023-2028 Plan and EUR 2,236 thousand to the 2018-2022 Plan (EUR 4,471
thousand in 2022). The stock market price of ACS shares at 31 December 2023 and 2022 was EUR 40.16
and EUR 26.77 per share, respectively.

The commitments arising from these plans are hedged through financial institutions (see Note 22). In
relation to the plans described above, the share options are to be settled through equity instruments and
never in cash. However, since the Parent Company has hedged the commitments arising from these plans
with a financial institution, their settlement will not involve, under any circumstances, the issue of equity
instruments in addition to those outstanding as at 31 December 2023. In 2023, EUR 4,471 thousand (see
Note 28.02) (EUR 4,471 thousand in 2022) related to share-based remuneration were recognised as
personnel expenses in the consolidated income statement, with a balancing entry in equity. To calculate the
total cost of the above share plans, the Parent Company considered the finance cost of the plans on the
date on which the plan was granted based on the futures curve on the notional value of each of them, the
effect of the estimated future dividends during the period of the plans, and the value of the put option
granted to the financial institution by applying the Black-Scholes formula. This cost is distributed over the
vesting years of the plan.

**HOCHTIEF**

Within the Hochtief Group, there are also share-based payment remuneration systems for the Group’s
management. All of these share option plans form part of the remuneration system for senior executives of
Hochtief, and long-term incentive plans. The provisions recognised for these share-based payment plans at
31 December 2023 totalled EUR 3,363 thousand (EUR 3,768 thousand at 31 December 2022). EUR 4,851
thousand (EUR 1,007 thousand in 2022) were taken to the consolidated income statement in this
connection in 2023. To hedge the risk of exposure to changes in the market price of the Hochtief shares, it
has a number of derivatives that are not considered to be accounting hedges.

The following share-based remuneration plans were in force for executives of Hochtief, A.G. and its
investees in 2023:

**Long-term Incentive Plan 2018**

The Long-term Incentive Plan 2018 (LTIP 2018) was launched in that same year by resolution of the

exercise period of two years after a waiting period of three years, entitled individuals receive from the issuer
a payment equal to the closing price of Hochtief shares on the last trading day on the stock markets before
the exercise date, plus a performance bonus. The amount of this bonus depends on the applicable effective
performance indicator for each company in the last full year before the exercise date. The performance
bonus for Executive Board members and executives of Hochtief, A.G. depends on the adjusted available
cash flow.

The gain is limited to EUR 533.70 per PSA.

The plan was fully exercised in 2023.

Provisions recognised for the share-based payment plans totalled EUR 3,363 thousand at the reporting date
(EUR 3,768 thousand in 2022). The total expenses recognised for the plans declared in 2023 amounted to
EUR 4,851 thousand (total income of EUR 1,007 thousand in 2022). The intrinsic value of the plans to be
exercised at the end of the reporting period was EUR 79 thousand (EUR 1,154 thousand in 2022).

**_28.04._** **_Changes in fair value of financial instruments_**

This heading includes the effect on the consolidated income statement of derivative instruments that do not
meet the efficiency criteria provided in IAS 39, or that are not hedging instruments. The most important
outcome in 2023 is the positive impact of derivatives on ACS shares (forward contracts settled by
differences), which resulted in a profit of EUR 360,885 thousand (a profit of EUR 123,737 thousand in
2022). Also taken into account is the effect of the derivatives of ACS, Actividades de Construcción y
Servicios, S.A. on the ACS share options, which gave rise to a profit of EUR 62,975 thousand (a profit of
EUR 40,992 thousand in 2022), as described in Note 22.

**_28.05._** **_Finance cost_**

The breakdown of finance costs in 2023 and 2022 is as follows:

|Financial costs|Millions of Euros|%|Millions of Euros|%|
|---|---|---|---|---|
||2023||2022||
|Debt-related financial expenses Financial expenses for Collateral and Guarantees Other financial expenses|558.6 21.4 79.1|85 3 12|361.1 27.1 96.0|75 6 19|
|Total|659.1|100|484.2|100|


**Millions of Euros** **%** **Millions of Euros** **%**

**Financial costs**

**2023** **2022**

Debt-related financial expenses 558.6 85 361.1 75

Financial expenses for Collateral and Guarantees 21.4 3 27.1 6

Other financial expenses 79.1 12 96.0 19

**Total** **659.1** **100** **484.2** **100**


Although finance costs have a limited impact since most of the Group’s debt is hedged against interest rate
fluctuations, the ordinary net finance expense rose as a result of higher interest rates for financing shortterm working capital, and financing derived from Iridium’s purchase of the SH288.

**29. Impairment and gains or losses on disposal of non-current assets and financial**

**instruments, other operating expenses and other gains or losses**

**_a) Impairment and gains or losses on disposal of non-current assets_**

In 2023, “Gains or losses on disposal of non-current assets” mainly includes the recognition of the capital
gain on the sale of 56.76% of the SH288 highway to Abertis Infraestructuras (see Note 02.02.f) for EUR 180
million and, in accordance with the standard on business combinations, the positive impact (with no effect
on cash flows) of the revaluation of the remaining 43.24% at fair value, amounting to EUR 262 million. In


-----

138

addition, “Impairment/Reversal of impairment on non-current assets” includes the amounts related to
provisions made to mitigate certain operational risks of the Group that were reassessed at year-end 2023.

In 2022, “Gains or losses on disposal of non-current assets” mainly included the following:

– The recognition of the capital gain relating to the purchase of an additional 56.76% of the SH288
highway, which, together with the 21.62% previously held, enabled the Group to obtain control of the
highway and manage its relevant activities. Therefore, instead of being accounted for using the
equity method, it was fully consolidated at fair value of the transaction, and, consequently, the
portion originally held by the Group was measured at fair value, with a positive impact in the amount
of EUR 334.8 million (see Note 02.02.f).

– The effects of the exclusion of Ventia from the scope of consolidation of Cimic in the first quarter of
2022 due to the loss of its status as associate, as a result of which it was recognised as a financial
asset under IFRS 9 at fair value through other comprehensive income, taking the market price of
Ventia at that date as the reference. This resulted in a profit (with no effect on cash flows) of EUR
338.3 million (AUD 502 million), as indicated in Note 02.02.f.

– On 11 April 2022, Cimic entered into an agreement with its consortium partners and JKC on all
matters in relation to the CCPP contract with a negative impact on Cimic’s income statement in the
amount of EUR 325 million (AUD 493 million), which was recognised under “Other operating
expenses” in the accompanying consolidated income statement. As a result, Cimic paid EUR 127
million in 2022 and EUR 183.5 million in 2023.

– The results of the agreements reached with the Vinci Group to modify certain carve out
transactions, such as the 24.99% holding of Zero-E Euro Assets, S.A., those relating to the
photovoltaic energy development projects in Spain, the sale of the Vientos del Pastorale, S.A. and
Parque Eólico Kiyú, S.A. wind farms in Uruguay, and the Hidromanta hydroelectric plant in Peru
owned by Spinning Assets, S.L.U. (see Note 03.09).

**_b) Impairment and gains or losses on disposal of financial instruments_**

The breakdown of “Impairment and gains or losses on disposal of financial instruments” in 2023 and 2022 is
as follows:

|Col1|Thousands of Euros|Col3|

**Total** **(79,165)** **7,345**


**_c) Other results_**

This heading includes any gains or losses recognised by the Group that are considered to be non-recurring,
mainly arising from the final settlement of lawsuits and disputes involving projects related termination
agreements and extraordinary work completed and indemnities relating to work concluded on various
international projects for a net loss of EUR 155 million in 2023 after taking into consideration the net use of
certain provisions for risks amounting to EUR 79 million (a loss of EUR 278 million in 2022).

**30. Distribution of profit**

As in previous years, at the date of the call notice of the Annual General Meeting, the Parent Company’s
Board of Directors agreed to propose an alternative remuneration system allowing shareholders to receive
bonus shares of the Company, or cash through the sale of the corresponding bonus issue rights. This option
would be instrumented through a bonus issue, which will be subject to approval by the shareholders at the
Company’s General Meeting. In the event that it is approved, the bonus issue could be executed by the


-----

139

Board of Directors on up to two occasions, in July and in the first few months of the following year,
coinciding with the times when dividends are customarily paid. During the execution of each bonus issue,
each shareholder of the Company receives a bonus issue right for each share. The rights received will be
traded on the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia Stock Exchanges. Depending on the alternative
chosen, shareholders would be able to either receive new bonus shares of the Company or sell their bonus
issue rights on the market or sell them to the Company at a specific price calculated using the established
formula.

The distribution of the profit for 2023 that the Parent’s Board will propose for approval at the Annual General
Meeting is the transfer to voluntary reserves of the Company’s entire profit for the year amounting to EUR
1,141,079 thousand.

**31. Earnings per share from continuing and discontinued operations**

**_31.01._** **_Basic earning per share_**

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to the Group by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding the average number of treasury
shares held in the year.

Accordingly:

**_31.02._** **_Diluted earnings per share_**

In calculating diluted earnings per share, the amount of profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and the
weighted average number of shares outstanding, net of treasury shares, are adjusted to take into account
all the dilutive effects inherent to potential ordinary shares (share options, warrants and convertible debt
instruments). For these purposes, it is considered that the shares are converted at the beginning of the year
or at the date of issue of the potential ordinary shares, if the latter were issued during the current period. The


-----

140

execution of the share plan and the ACS share option plan currently in force at 31 December 2023 (see
Note 28.03) does not involve the issuance of new shares in the future and, therefore, does not affect diluted
earnings per share. At 31 December 2023, as a result of the simultaneous share capital increase and
reduction decided in 2023 for the same number of shares, basic earnings and diluted earnings per share for
continuing operations for the first half of 2023 are the same.

**32. Events after the reporting date**

On 8 January 2024, ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. agreed to carry out the second
capital increase with a charge to reserves approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held
on 5 May 2023. The purpose of the capital increase is to implement a flexible formula for shareholder
remuneration (“optional dividend”), so that shareholders may choose to continue to receive cash
remuneration or to receive new shares in the Company.

Furthermore, the Company agreed to carry out the first capital reduction through the retirement of treasury
shares, which was approved at the same General Meeting, for a maximum amount equal to the amount by
which the share capital was actually increased as a result of the first capital increase referred to in the
previous paragraph.

The maximum number of new shares to be issued in the first capital increase charged to reserves agreed at
the Annual General Meeting held on 5 May 2023 (through which an optional dividend in shares or cash is
structured) was set at 3,234,472 shares on 16 January 2024.

ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. agreed to purchase from its shareholders the bonus
issue rights corresponding to this first capital increase at a price that was set at a fixed gross amount of EUR
0.457 for each right.

After the negotiation period for the bonus issue rights corresponding to the first bonus issue, the irrevocable
commitment to purchase rights assumed by ACS was accepted by the holders of 35.45% of the bonus issue
rights. After the decision-making period granted to the shareholders had elapsed, in January 2024 the
following events took place:

– The dividend was determined to be a total gross amount of EUR 45,067,502.86 (EUR 0.457 per
share) and was paid on 6 February 2024.

– The final number of shares subject to the capital increase was 1,875,974 for a nominal amount of
EUR 937,987.00, which were redeemed simultaneously for the same amount (see Note 08.02).

On 30 January 2024, in relation to the Supreme Court judgment handed down the previous day, which rules
on the appeal filed by ACESA — a subsidiary of Abertis — in relation to the AP 7 agreement, ACS reported
that the impact of this ruling on its consolidated financial statements is a loss of EUR 14.5 million and that it
has already been taken into account in the profit for 2023.

At 15 February 2024, the commitment relating to the capital increase of EUR 390 million (30% of the total
EUR 1,300 million commitment) approved by Abertis Holdco’s shareholders prior to the reporting date (see
Note 09).

The Texas Transportation Commission (USA) met on March 28, 2024 to authorize the creation of a
transportation corporation and the possible early termination of the concession contract for the SH-288
highway, currently owned by the ACS Group and Abertis, which has been operating with outstanding
success since it came into operation in November 2020. The termination fee maintained by the grantor
amounts to approximately US$1,732 million.

However, the Commission has announced that prior to the decision, a six-month period will be opened in
which possible alternatives that avoid such early termination and that reflect the interest of the State of
Texas and the investor shareholders will be negotiated.

Pension plans 2,239 2,062

Life insurances 53 52


The increase in remuneration (fixed and variable) of the Group’s senior executives is basically due to the
change in the composition of senior management and the increase in the number of senior executives. The
amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement in 2023 as a result of ACS shares and share
options (see Note 28.03) granted to the Group’s executives in July 2018 and July 2023 amounted to EUR
1,960 thousand, of which EUR 1,538 thousand correspond to the 2023 Plan and EUR 422 thousand to the
2018 Plan (EUR 2,757 thousand in 2022) and are not included in the above remuneration. Similarly, as
indicated in the case of directors, these amounts relate to the proportion of the value of the plan on the date
it was granted.

The ACS Group does not have any balances with and has not granted any advances, loans or guarantees
to any of the senior executives at 31 December 2023 and 2022.

**35. Other disclosures concerning the Board of Directors**

In accordance with the information held by the Company, no direct or indirect conflicts of interest arise with
the Company as set out in applicable regulations (currently in accordance with that established in section
229 of the Corporate Enterprises Act), all without prejudice to the information on related party transactions
reflected in the notes to the financial statements. The amount corresponding to the premiums for the thirdparty liability insurance taken out on behalf of the Parent Company’s directors, among others, amounted to
EUR 2,266 thousand in 2023 (EUR 2,399 thousand in 2022).

In 2023 and 2022, the Company had commercial relationships with companies in which some of their
directors perform management functions. All these commercial relationships were carried out on an arm’s
length basis in the ordinary course of business, and related to ordinary Company transactions.

**36. Guarantee commitments to third parties and other contingent liabilities**

The ACS Group has provided guarantees and sureties to third parties in connection with its business
activities, with the amounts arranged for these line items detailed as follows:

|Col1|Thousands of Euros|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||Disposed 31/12/2023 31/12/2022||

Guarantees and guarantees in relation to Bonding Lines 19,825,376 16,848,333

**Total** **27,634,190** **24,074,836**


The limit of the guarantees and sureties granted to third parties at 31 December 2023 amounted to EUR
32,033,058 thousand (EUR 29,359,222 thousand at 31 December 2022).

The financial guarantees amounting to EUR 228 million (EUR 268 million at 31 December 2022) include
EUR 24 million for progress guarantees (EUR 66 million at 31 December 2022), EUR 88 million correspond
to capital contribution commitments for projects (EUR 93 million at 31 December 2022), with the remaining
EUR 116 million corresponding to other financial guarantees (EUR 110 million at 31 December 2022). The
year-on-year increase in technical guarantees and guarantees and sureties in relation to bonding lines is
mainly due to the inclusion of new projects and to a lesser extent to fluctuations in the exchange rate.

The guarantees and sureties in relation to bonding lines mentioned in the table above correspond to the
guarantee of execution of the projects and operations carried out by Dragados and Hochtief mainly in the
United States and Canada signed with various insurance companies.

The above amounts include the guarantees granted by Cimic on the sale of Thiess to Elliot (as described in
Note 09). The ACS Group has recognised as a derivative financial instrument the value of the put option for
Elliott to sell all or part of its 50% interest in Thiess to Cimic after the third year, i.e., four to six years after
the sale on 31 December 2020. At 31 December 2023, the fair value of the put option (see Note 22) was
determined to be AUD 0, equivalent to EUR 0 (AUD 4.35 million, equivalent to EUR 2.77 million at 31
December 2022). In addition, in relation to Elliot, Thiess issued Class C preference shares, as indicated in
Notes 09 and 22. Therefore, there are agreements relating to Thiess Class C preference shares. Under the
agreement, Elliott has the option to sell its Class C preference shares to Cimic within 42 months. The term
begins six months after the period for exercising the put option expires or six months after the date on which
Elliott ceases to hold the shares or announces that it will exercise the option to sell all remaining shares (the
“Thiess option”). At 31 December 2023, the fair value of the Thiess option was determined to be AUD 1.62
million, equivalent to EUR 1 million (AUD 1.68 million, equivalent to EUR 1.07 million at 31 December 2022).

The ACS Group’s directors do not expect any material liabilities additional to those recognised in the
accompanying consolidated statement of financial position to arise as a result of the transactions described
in this Note. The contingent liabilities include the normal liability of the companies with which the Group
carries out its business activities. Normal liability is that related to compliance with the contractual
obligations assumed in the course of the construction or maintenance services or assistance to people, both
by the companies themselves or the unincorporated joint ventures in which they have interests.

This coverage is achieved by means of the corresponding guarantees provided to secure the performance
of the contracts, compliance with the obligations assumed in the concession agreements, etc.

All of the project financing, including that under “Non-current assets in projects” and that under “Non-current
assets held for sale and discontinued operations” in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial
position, whether fully consolidated or accounted for using the equity method, has construction guarantees
until the project enters into service.

The Group has income recognition policies in place for its construction activities that are based on the
certainty of collection, in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the agreements executed.

However, there are certain outstanding balances receivable that are under dispute with the corresponding
customers or even — particularly as regards international works — that require certain experts necessary to
intermediate as arbitration processes have commenced to resolve such disputes.

As for litigation-related payments made by the ACS Group in 2023, the payments made to settle the
litigation involving Radials 3 and 5 and the last payment relating to the CCPP Ichthys project in Australia
amounted to a total of EUR 234 million (see Note 03.23).

**_36.02._** **_Other contingent liabilities_**

In the course of its activities, the ACS Group is subject to various types of contingent liabilities that arise
from litigation or administrative proceedings. It is reasonable to consider that they will not have a material
effect on the economic and financial position or on the solvency of the Group, and provisions have been
made insofar as they may have a material adverse effect.

**In relation to the ACS Group’s investment in Alazor (R3 and R5 highways), on 10 March 2023, Alazor**
Inversiones, S.A.’s creditor funds and banks entered into a settlement agreement with ACS, Actividades de
Construcción y Servicios, S.A.; Desarrollo de Concesiones Viarias Uno, S.L.; Autopistas, C.E.S.A.; and
Iberpistas, S.A., in the presence of the trustees in bankruptcy, with respect to all the proceedings relating to
successive lawsuits filed by Alazor’s financial creditors against the shareholders and guarantors (the
“Settlement Agreement”).

The following lawsuits were part of this settlement:

1. The claim for declaratory proceedings filed in May 2019 by Haitong Bank, S.A. Sucursal en España,
acting as agent of the financing syndicate, invoking clause 4 (viii) of the Support Agreement, in
which it claimed the direct payment of EUR 562.5 million plus interest (of which EUR 132.8 million
plus interest corresponded to the ACS Group). Court of the First Instance no. 26 of Madrid upheld
the claim in a judgment dated 2 November 2021, ruling against Alazor’s shareholders and their
respective guarantors. The defendants filed an appeal against this judgment on 20 December 2021,
and a ruling has yet to be handed down by Section 13 of the Madrid Provincial Court.

The joint application by the signatories of the Settlement Agreement for the termination of this
lawsuit as a result of an out-of-court settlement and without awarding costs was upheld by the
Madrid Provincial Court by the order dated 23 November 2023. The lawsuit was therefore
considered to be concluded for ACS, DCV1, Autopistas and Iberpistas, continuing only for the Funds
and Sacyr. The lawsuit was therefore considered to be concluded for ACS, DCV1, Autopistas and
Iberpistas, continuing only for the Funds and Sacyr. Subsequent to year-end, a total of EUR 50,627
thousand was received in accordance with the Settlement Agreement reached between the creditor
funds and banks of Alazor Inversiones, S.A. and ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A.
and Desarrollo de Concesiones Viarias Uno (DCV1), S.L.”.

2. The claim for declaratory proceedings filed in January 2019 by the creditor funds and banks,
invoking clause 2 and clause 5 of the Support Agreement to claim contributions in favour of Alazor,
in relation to expropriation cost overruns and compliance with refinancing ratios, for a total amount
of EUR 757 million plus interest (of which EUR 169 million would correspond to the ACS Group).
Court of the First Instance no. 13 of Madrid dismissed the lawsuit in its entirety through a judgment
dated 7 November 2022, acquitting the shareholders and guarantors. The Funds filed an appeal on
13 December 2022, which was considered to have been filed by the Court on 15 June 2023,
although the case files have not yet been sent to the Madrid Provincial Court.

In this case, the application for termination as a result of an out-of-court settlement under the
Settlement Agreement was filed with the Court on 15 March 2023 and, after the hearing took place,
a ruling has yet to be handed down.

3. The claim filed by the shareholders and guarantors before Court of the First Instance no. 51 of
Madrid for harm and loss caused after the Provincial Court revoked the enforcement order issued in
February 2014 in the first lawsuit relating to clause 4 (viii) of the Support Agreement.


-----

146

The corresponding application for termination as a result of an out-of-court settlement was upheld
by the Court by means of a decree dated 21 March 2023.

**In relation to the ACS Group’s investment in Irasa (R2 highway), through a claim for declaratory**
proceedings filed in September 2019, the creditor funds invoked clauses 2.1.2 and 2.1.4 of the
Shareholders’ Commitment Agreement to claim payment for EUR 471.8 million in principal, plus EUR 79.7
million in interest (of which EUR 165.1 million and EUR 27.9 million would correspond to the ACS Group,
respectively), for construction and expropriation cost overruns and contingent contributions. This claim was
dismissed, with an order to pay court costs, by Madrid Court of the First Instance no. 37 in a judgement
dated 14 July 2022. The appeal filed by the Funds was also dismissed with an order to pay costs, and the
ruling was handed down by Section 10 of the Madrid Provincial Court through a judgment dated 21
December 2023. The Funds have filed an appeal to the Supreme Court against this last judgment (the Court
considered it to have been filed on 12 February 2024), and the Admissions Section of the First Chamber of
the Supreme Court has yet to decide whether or not to grant it leave to proceed.

**In relation to the insolvency proceedings involving the R2 and the R3-R5 highways, (Henarsa, Irasa,**
Accesos de Madrid and Alazor), they were all declared to be not at fault. The trustees in bankruptcy of
Henarsa and Accesos de Madrid handed over the operation of the R2, R3 and R5 highways to the State in
documents dated 28 February and 9 May 2018, respectively; they are now being managed by the Ministry
of Transport, Mobility and Urban Agenda through SEITTSA — the state-owned land transport infrastructure
company — under an agreement signed in August 2017, which was initially extended until 2022, and was
once again extended until 2032.

**In relation to the concession agreement for the Lima Metro Line 2 Project in Peru, the concession**
**operator Metro de Lima Línea 2, S.A.** ((in which Iridium Concesiones de Infraestructuras, S.A. holds a
25% interest) filed the following requests for arbitration:

ICSID Arbitration 1: On 16 January 2017, a request for arbitration against the Republic of Peru (Ministry of
Transport and Communications) before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of other States (“ICSID”) for serious breach by the Republic of Peru of the
concession agreement mainly consisting of: (i) the failure by the Concession Area to make delivery under
the terms and conditions established in the concession agreement, and (ii) the lack of approval and delayed
approval of the Detailed Engineering Studies (“ICSID 1”).

In 2018, several briefs were filed requesting an extension of the term of execution of the Project works and
compensation for damages in excess of USD 700 million, which include damages incurred by different
participants in the Project (concession operator, construction group, rolling stock supplier, etc.). The
Republic of Peru rejected the claims made and included a counterclaim against the concession operator,
claiming an amount in excess of USD 700 million for socio-economic and environmental damage.

Both the claim brought by the concession operator against Peru and the counterclaim by Peru against the
concession operator have been consolidated into a single arbitration process with the ICSID. The legal
process having followed its normal course, in the first half of May 2019, the evidentiary hearing was held in
Washington, where various witnesses gave testimony, two rounds of briefs were presented during June and
July 2019 in relation to issues raised during the evidentiary hearing, and final pleadings were presented by
both the concession operator and the State of Peru on 20 September 2019.

On 6 July 2021, the Court issued a partial award through the “Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability”, which
dismissed the counterclaim of the Republic of Peru and upheld virtually all of the claims of the concession
operator, with the final award yet to be handed down on the amount of damages and costs of the
proceedings. In particular, the Decision declares that (1) the Republic of Peru has breached its obligation to
deliver most of the Areas of Stage 1A and all of the Areas of Stages 1B and 2 within the periods agreed, and
(2) the Republic of Peru has breached its contractual obligations regarding the procedure for overseeing
and approving the Detailed Engineering Studies, and that the Republic of Peru has failed to properly
exercise its contractual supervisory role. As regards damages due to delays, the claim for damages due to
delays in relation to Stages 2 and 1B is fully upheld and partially upheld for Stage 1A. On 11 August 2021,
the Court issued Procedural Order no. 8 instructing the experts of the concession operator and of Peru to
perform additional calculations based on the findings set forth in the Decision. On 11 October 2021,


-----

147

following the Court’s procedural order, based on the delays determined by the Court in the Decision, the
concession operator reduced its claim from USD 109.0 million to USD 84.7 million and the other members
of the consortium other than the concession operator also made an adjustment to the damages initially
claimed. On 30 December 2021, the concession grantor submitted to the Court its response to the
concession operator’s adjusted damage calculations, rejecting most of these damages and submitting much
lower alternative calculations. On 31 January 2022, the Parties submitted a joint WACC Calculator to the
Arbitral Tribunal and, subsequently, each party has submitted its own “instructions” for using the Calculator.
The Arbitral Tribunal sent a notice on 27 June 2023 inviting the parties to file their written submissions on
court costs. The award for damages is expected to be issued in the second quarter of 2024.

ICSID Arbitration 2: On 2 August 2021, the concession operator filed a new request for arbitration against
Peru with the ICSID Secretariat, following the expiration of the 6-month period for direct negotiations as
required by the concession agreement. As in the case of ICSID 1, this claim is mainly for serious breach by
the Republic of Peru of the Concession Agreement for (i) the failure by the Concession Area to make
delivery, and (ii) the lack of approval and delayed approval of the Detailed Engineering Studies under the
terms and conditions established in Addendum 2 to the Concession Agreement, along with the updated cost
overruns, and harm and loss incurred after the cut-off dates considered in ICSID 1 (“ICSID 2”).

On 16 May 2022, the Secretary-General of the ICSID reported that the three arbitrators had accepted their
respective appointments and, therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal was duly constituted and the procedure
initiated. The first session of the Tribunal was held on 17 June 2022 and an agreement was reached for
Procedural Order no. 1, which regulates, among other matters, the procedural timetable. On 16 December
2022, the concession operator filed a Statement of Claim with the ICSID. The Republic of Peru filed its
Statement of Defence on 2 October 2023.

ICSID Arbitration 3: On 15 November 2021, the concession operator filed a new request for arbitration
against Peru with the ICSID Secretariat, following the expiration of the 6-month period for direct negotiations
as required by the concession agreement. The claim filed against Peru is regarding the dispute over (i) the
lack of approval of the Polynomial Formulas for the adjustment to the Work Progress and Provision
Progress, (ii) the delay in the certification and payment of the adjustments arising from the application of
these Polynomial Formulas, and (iii) the economic and financial loss due to the delay in payment of the
adjustments (“ICSID 3”).

The expert has prepared the draft preliminary expert report, which is currently being reviewed by the
working group. On 11 April 2023, the Secretary-General of the ICSID reported that the three arbitrators had
accepted their respective appointments and, therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal was duly constituted and the
procedure initiated. The first session of the Arbitral Tribunal was held on 29 May 2023. The concession
operator filed the Statement of Claim on 29 September 2023.

**On 1 October 2018, an accusation was brought against Dragados and other companies for possible**
**infringements of section 1 of the Spanish Competition Act (Ley de Defensa de la Competencia) and**
Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, consisting of agreements and
exchanges of information between these companies in the field of tenders held by the various public
authorities in Spain for the construction and refurbishment of infrastructures and buildings. On 16 July 2020,
this accusation was declared to have exceeded its validity, although on 6 August 2020 a new accusation
was brought in relation to the same facts as the expired accusation. On 16 September 2020, Dragados filed
an appeal for judicial review against the ruling that decreed the expiration, which was admitted on 9 October
2020, with the claim being filed on 16 December 2020. On 6 July 2021, the Directorate of Competition of the
CNMC issued a new preliminary ruling for the new accusation with proposed liquidated damages of EUR 58
million, indicating that the company could also be banned from entering into contracts with public authorities.
The corresponding pleadings have been submitted against this preliminary ruling. On 15 July 2022, the
CNMC served notice that a ruling had been handed down imposing a fine of EUR 57.1 million on Dragados.
This fine was appealed before the National Appellate Court and on 19 January 2023 the Court handed down
its decision to suspend payment of the fine in exchange for the provision of a guarantee, which was
provided in February 2023. Dragados and its external advisers consider that the action that was subject to
this fine is not unlawful and did not restrict competition, and consider the fine to be disproportionate and
lacking in justification. The Group’s Management considers that the final ruling on this matter is unlikely to
have a significant effect on the Group.

148

As regards the proceedings in progress described above, the directors, with the support of their legal
advisors, do not expect any material liabilities additional to those recognised in the Consolidated Annual
Accounts to arise from the transactions or the results of the proceedings described in this note.

**37. Information on the environment**

The ACS Group combines its business aims with the objective of protecting the environment and
appropriately managing the expectations of its stakeholders in this area. The ACS Environmental Policy
defines the general principles to be followed, but are sufficiently flexible to accommodate the elements of
policy and planning development by the companies in the various business areas and meet the
requirements of the most recent version of the ISO 14001 standard and other commitments assumed by the
companies to other environmental standards, such as EMAS, or standards relating to their carbon footprint
or water footprint. This Policy establishes the following commitments:

1. To comply with applicable regulations and standards in general and other voluntary commitments
entered into in each of the offices, branches, projects, works and services of the ACS Group.

2. To prevent contamination, by assessing the potential environmental risks at every stage of a project,
job or service, with the aim of designing processes that minimise environmental impact as far as
possible.

3. To continuously improve management of environmental activities, by setting and following up on
environmental goals.

4. To strive for transparency in external communications, by periodically publishing information about
environmental initiatives to all stakeholders, meeting their demands and expectations, either in
compliance with regulations or independently.

5. To enhance skills and raise awareness, by providing training and educational activities to
employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders.

The significant level of implementation of an environmental management system verified by a third party,
present in companies representing 93.2% of Group sales, is based on the objective of seeking adoption of
the ISO 14001 standard in the majority of the Group’s activities, which is implemented in 83.2% of the ACS
Group’s operations.

To implement and roll out a policy based on these environmental commitments, the most significant
commitments are identified at the corporate level, based on their impact on the environment and external
requirements, and are then compared with each company’s management systems and the environmental
priorities for each business activity.

Considering the environmental impacts identified, the main environmental activities of ACS Group
companies will be specifically and operationally focused around four main areas:

1. Energy and emissions.

2. Circular economy.

3. Efficient and responsible use of water resources.

4. Biodiversity.

For more information on these impacts, see the Non-Financial Information Statement in the ACS Group’s
Consolidated Directors’ Report for 2023.

Environmental expenses incurred in 2023 amounted to EUR 5,938 thousand (EUR 14,840 thousand in
2022).

The ACS Group’s main auditor in 2023 was Deloitte (KPMG in 2022).

In relation to services provided in Spain:

– The fees relating to audit services provided by Deloitte, S.L. for the financial statements amounted
to EUR 2,249 thousand (EUR 1,957 thousand in 2022 by KPMG Auditores, S.L.). These fees
include those related to the limited half-yearly reviews.

– Fees for non-audit services provided by Deloitte amounted to EUR 731 thousand (EUR 321
thousand in 2022 by KPMG Auditores, S.L.).

In relation to the main auditor, the table above shows that the amount for “Services required by accounting
regulations” includes mainly the verification of the Non-Financial Reporting Statement. “Other verification
services” mainly includes the ICFR report, comfort letter work and due diligence work. Lastly, “Tax services”
mainly includes tax services related to general advisory services.

**39. Explanation added for translation to English**

These consolidated financial statements are presented on the basis of IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union. Certain accounting practices applied by the Group that conform with IFRSs may not conform with
other generally accepted accounting principles.

### APPENDICES


-----

151

As stated in Note 02 to the financial statements, Appendices I and II list the subsidiaries, unincorporated
joint ventures and economic interest groupings of the ACS Group in 2023, including their registered office
and the Group’s effective percentage of ownership. The effective percentage indicated in the Appendices
includes, in the event it is applicable to subsidiaries, the proportionate part of the treasury shares held by the
subsidiary.

For the companies domiciled in the Group’s four main countries — Spain, Germany, Australia and the
United States —, covering about 88% of sales, a breakdown is provided for the registered office of the main
headquarters or management office, expressly declared for income tax purposes in the country of residence
(in particular, ‘domicilio fiscal’ in Spain, ‘geschaftsanschrift’ in Germany, ‘business address of main business’
in Australia and ‘corporation’s principal office’ or ‘place of business’ in the United States). In the other
countries, the registered office given is the address considered legally relevant in each case.

The information is grouped in accordance with the management criteria of the ACS Group on the basis of
the different business segments or lines of business carried on in 2023 and 2022. Note 25.01 explains the
bases for segmentation and the reorganisation carried out in the year and their restatement for the purposes
of comparison, in relation to the construction and concessions businesses.

**_1._** **_CONSTRUCTION_**

This business segment includes the construction activities through Dragados and Hochtief (including Cimic)
and is aimed at carrying out all types of civil construction projects, building projects and infrastructure
services.

Information is separated on the basis of the two companies heading this line of business:

– Dragados

This includes both domestic and foreign activities relating to civil construction works (highways and
roads, railways, hydraulic infrastructures, coasts and ports, etc.), and residential and non-residential
buildings.

– Hochtief

This segment includes the activities carried on by the different business segments of this company:

-  Hochtief Americas - Its activities are mainly carried on in the US and Canada and relate to the
construction of buildings (public and private), infrastructure, civil engineering, and educational
and sports facilities.

-  Hochtief Asia Pacific - Its activities are carried on by its Australian subsidiary Cimic, in particular
construction, mining contracts (mainly through the Thiess joint venture), operation and
maintenance, and the development of real estate infrastructures.

-  Hochtief Europe - This segment mainly operates through Hochtief Solutions, A.G., which
designs, develops, constructs and operates infrastructure projects, real estate and facilities.

**_2. CONCESSIONS_**

The Concessions area includes the activities of Iridium and the shareholdings in Abertis and is focused on
the development and operation of transport concessions.

– Iridium
It carries out infrastructure promotion and development, both in relation to transport and public
facilities, managing different public-private collaboration models.

– Abertis

This relates to the ACS Group’s ownership interest in Abertis.


-----

152

**_3. SERVICES_**

This area only includes Clece’s business activity, which offers comprehensive maintenance services for
buildings, public places and organisations, and assistance to people. This area is mainly based in Spain but
also shows incipient growth in the European market. Although this segment does not meet the quantitative
thresholds established in IFRS 8, the Group considers that it should be reported as a differentiated segment
since the nature of the goods and services it provides is wholly differentiated and identifiable, it reports
independently to the Group, and this presentation is considered to be more useful to the users of the
financial statements.

**_4.- CORPORATE UNIT_**

This includes the activity of the Group’s Parent Company, ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios,
S.A., in addition to other activities that cannot be assigned to the other business segments that are
presented separately, such as the property assets developed by Cogesa and the renewable energy and
water assets that the Group still holds after the sale of the Industrial business to Vinci in 2021, plus the
effects of consolidation.
